M.]  \n \n\n7 \n \n \n \nSTAVE  I \nMARLEY’S GHOST \n \nMARLEY was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about \nthat. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, \nthe undertaker, and the c hief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And \nScrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put \nhis hand to.  \nOld Marley was as dead as a door-nail.  \nMind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, \nwhat there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been \ninclined, myself, to regard a c offin-nail as the deadest piece of \nironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the \nsimile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s \ndone for. You will t herefore permit m e to repeat, emphatically, that \nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.  \nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be \notherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t know how many \nyears. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole \nassign, h is s ole residuary legatee, h is s ole friend, and sole mourner. \nAnd even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but \nthat he was an excellent m an o f business on the very day of the \nfuneral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.  \nThe mention of Marley’s funeral brings me back to the point I \nstarted from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be \ndistinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I \nam going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet’s \nFather died before the play began, there would b e nothing more \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 8 \nremarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his \nown ramparts, than there would b e in any other middle-aged \ngentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say Saint \nPaul’s Churchyard for instance—literally to astonish his son’s weak \nmind.  \nScrooge never painted out Old Marley’s name. There it stood, \nyears afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge a nd Marley. \nThe firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new \nto the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he \nanswered to both names. It was all the same to him.  \nOh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a \nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, o ld \nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck \nout generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. \nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, \nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips \nblue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was \non his head, and on h is eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his \nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the \ndog-days; and didn’t thaw it one degree at Christmas.  \nExternal heat and cold h ad little influence on Scrooge. No \nwarmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew \nwas bitterer than h e, n o falling snow w as more intent upon its \npurpose, no p elting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn’t \nknow where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and \nsleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They \noften “came down” handsomely, and Scrooge never did.  \nNobody ever stopped h im i n the street t o say, with gladsome \nlooks, “My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see \nme?” No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked \nhim what it was o’clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life \ninquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind \nmen’s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming \non, would tug their owners into doo rways and up courts; and then \nwould wag their tails as though they said, “No eye at all is better than \nan evil eye, dark master!”  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 9 \nBut what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To \nedge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human \nsympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call “nuts” \nto Scrooge.  \nOnce upon a time—of all t he good d ays in the year, on  \nChristmas Eve—old Scrooge sat busy in h is counting-house. It was \ncold, b leak, b iting weather: foggy withal: and h e c ould h ear the \npeople in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their \nhands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement \nstones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it \nwas quite dark already—it had no t been light all day—and candles \nwere flaring in the windows of the neighbouring o ffices, like ruddy \nsmears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every \nchink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court \nwas of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To \nsee the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one \nmight have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a \nlarge scale.  \nThe door of Scrooge’s counting-house was open that he might \nkeep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort \nof tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, bu t t he \nclerk’s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But \nhe c ouldn’t replenish it, for Scrooge kept t he coal-box in his own \nroom; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master \npredicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the \nclerk pu t on h is white comforter, and tried to warm himself at t he \ncandle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he \nfailed.  \n“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful \nvoice. It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon him so \nquickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.  \n“Bah!” said Scrooge, “Humbug!”  \nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, \nthis nephew of Scrooge’s, that he was all i n a glow; his face was \nruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 10 \n“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “You \ndon’t mean that, I am sure?”  \n“I do,” said Scrooge. “Merry Christmas! What right have you to \nbe merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”  \n“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you \nto b e dismal? What reason h ave you to b e morose? You’re rich \nenough.”  \nScrooge having no b etter answer ready on the spur of the \nmoment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”  \n“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.  \n“What else can I be,” returned the uncle, “when I live in such a \nworld of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! \nWhat’s Christmas time to you bu t a time for paying bills without \nmoney; a time for f inding yourself a year older, bu t not an hou r \nricher; a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’em \nthrough a round dozen o f months presented d ead against you? If I  \ncould work my will,” said Scrooge indignantly, “every idiot who goes \nabout with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his \nown pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He \nshould!”  \n“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.  \n“Nephew!” returned the uncle, sternly, “keep Christmas in your \nown way, and let me keep it in mine.”  \n“Keep it!” repeated Scrooge’s nephew. “But you don’t keep it.”  \n“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Scrooge. “Much good may it \ndo you! Much good it has ever done you!”  \n“There are many things from which I might have derived good, \nby which I have not profited, I dare say,” returned the nephew. \n“Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of \nChristmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration \ndue to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be \napart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant \ntime; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when \nmen and women seem by one c onsent t o op en their shut-up h earts \nfreely, and to think o f people below them as if they really were \nfellow-passengers to the grave, and no t another r ace of creatures \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 11 \nbound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put \na scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me \ngood, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”  \nThe c lerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming \nimmediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and \nextinguished the last frail spark for ever.  \n“Let me hear another sound from you,” said Scrooge, “and you’ll \nkeep your Christmas by losing your situation! You’re quite a \npowerful speaker, sir,” he a dded, turning to his nephew. “I wonder \nyou don’t go into Parliament.”  \n“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.”  \nScrooge said that he would see him—yes, indeed h e did. He \nwent the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see \nhim in that extremity first.  \n“But why?” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “Why?”  \n“Why did you get married?” said Scrooge.  \n“Because I fell in love.”  \n“Because you fell in love!” growled Scrooge, as if that were the \nonly one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \n“Good afternoon!”  \n“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. \nWhy give it as a reason for not coming now?”  \n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.  \n“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we \nbe friends?”  \n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.  \n“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have \nnever had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made \nthe trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my Christmas humour \nto the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”  \n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.  \n“And A Happy New Year!”  \n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.  \nHis nephew left t he room without an angry word, \nnotwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 12 \nof the season on the c lerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than \nScrooge; for he returned them cordially.  \n“There’s another fellow,” muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: \n“my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife a nd family, \ntalking about a merry Christmas. I’ll retire to Bedlam.”  \nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge’s nephew out, had let two other \npeople in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now \nstood, with their hats off, in Scrooge’s office. They had book s and \npapers in their hands, and bowed to him.  \n“Scrooge a nd Marley’s, I believe,” said on e of the gentlemen, \nreferring to his list. “Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, \nor Mr. Marley?”  \n“Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,” Scrooge replied. \n“He died seven years ago, this very night.”  \n“We have no doub t his liberality is well represented by his \nsurviving partner,” said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.  \nIt certainly was; for they had b een two k indred spirits. At the \nominous word “liberality,” Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and \nhanded the credentials back.  \n“At t his festive season o f the year, Mr. Scrooge,” said the \ngentleman, taking up a pen, “it is more than usually desirable that we \nshould make some slight provision for the Poor and d estitute, who \nsuffer greatly at t he present tim e. Many thousands are in want of \ncommon necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common \ncomforts, sir.”  \n“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge.  \n“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman, laying do wn the pen \nagain.  \n“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Scrooge. “Are they \nstill in operation?”  \n“They are. Still,” returned the gentleman, “I wish I could say \nthey were not.”  \n“The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?” said \nScrooge.  \n“Both very busy, sir.”  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 13 \n“Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had \noccurred to stop them in their useful course,” said Scrooge. “I’m very \nglad to hear it.”  \n“Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer \nof mind or body to the multitude,” returned the gentleman, “a few of \nus are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and \ndrink, and means of warmth. We c hoose this time, b ecause it i s a \ntime, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. \nWhat shall I put you down for?”  \n“Nothing!” Scrooge replied.  \n“You wish to be anonymous?”  \n“I wish to be left alone,” said Scrooge. “Since you ask me what I \nwish, gentlemen, that i s my answer. I don’t m ake merry myself at \nChristmas and I can’t afford to make idle people merry. I help to \nsupport the establishments I have mentioned—they cost enough; and \nthose who are badly off must go there.”  \n“Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.”  \n“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, \nand d ecrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I don’t \nknow that.”  \n“But you might know it,” observed the gentleman.  \n“It’s not my business,” Scrooge returned. “It’s enough for a man \nto und erstand h is own bu siness, and no t t o interfere with o ther \npeople’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!”  \nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the \ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved \nopinion o f himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual \nwith him.  \nMeanwhile the fog and d arkness thickened so, that people ran \nabout with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses \nin carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a \nchurch, whose gruff old b ell was always peeping slily down at \nScrooge out of a gothic window in the wall, b ecame invisible, and \nstruck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations \nafterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. \nThe cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 14 \nsome labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great \nfire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were \ngathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze \nin rapture. The water-plug being left i n solitude, its overflowings \nsullenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of \nthe shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of \nthe windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers’ and \ngrocers’ trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with \nwhich it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as \nbargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the \nstronghold o f the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to h is fifty \ncooks and bu tlers to k eep Christmas as a Lord Mayor’s household \nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on \nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, \nstirred up to-morrow’s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and \nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.  \nFoggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, b iting cold. If the \ngood Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit’s nose with a touch \nof such weather as that, instead o f using his familiar weapons, then \nindeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant \nyoung nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are \ngnawed by dogs, stooped do wn at Scrooge’s keyhole to regale him \nwith a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of  \n \n“God bless you, merry gentleman! \n  May nothing you dismay!”  \n \nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that t he singer \nfled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial \nfrost.  \nAt l ength the hour of shutting up the c ounting-house a rrived. \nWith an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his s tool, and tacitly \nadmitted the fact t o the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly \nsnuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.  \n“You’ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?” said Scrooge.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 15 \n“If quite convenient, sir.”  \n“It’s not convenient,” said Scrooge, “and it’s not fair. If I was to \nstop half-a-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill-used, I’ll be bound?”  \nThe clerk smiled faintly.  \n“And yet,” said Scrooge, “you don ’t t hink me ill-used, when I \npay a day’s wages for no work.”  \nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.  \n“A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every twenty-fifth of \nDecember!” said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. “But I \nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all t he earlier next \nmorning.”  \nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with \na growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the \nlong ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he \nboasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a \nlane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and \nthen ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at \nblindman’s-buff.  \nScrooge took h is melancholy dinner in h is usual m elancholy \ntavern; and having read all t he newspapers, and beguiled the rest of \nthe e vening with h is banker’s-book, went home to b ed. He lived in \nchambers which h ad o nce belonged to h is deceased p artner. They \nwere a  gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a \nyard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help \nfancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at \nhide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again. It \nwas old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but \nScrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices. The yard was so \ndark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope \nwith his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway \nof the house, that i t seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat i n \nmournful meditation on the threshold.  \nNow, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the \nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that \nScrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in \nthat place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 16 \nhim as any man in the c ity of London, even including—which is a \nbold word—the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne \nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since \nhis last mention of his seven-years’ dead partner that afternoon. And \nthen let any man explain to me, if he ca n, ho w it happened that \nScrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, \nwithout it s undergoing any intermediate process of change—not a \nknocker, but Marley’s face.  \nMarley’s face. It was not i n impenetrable shadow as the other \nobjects in the yard were, bu t had a dismal li ght about it , like a bad \nlobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at \nScrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on \nits ghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or \nhot air; and, though the e yes were wide open, they were perfectly \nmotionless. That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror \nseemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a \npart of its own expression.  \nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker \nagain.  \nTo say that he was not startled, o r that his blood was not \nconscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from \ninfancy, would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had \nrelinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.  \nHe did p ause, with a moment’s irresolution, b efore he shut t he \ndoor; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected \nto be terrified with the sight of Marley’s pigtail sticking out into the \nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws \nand nu ts that held the knocker on, so h e said “Pooh, pooh !” a nd \nclosed it with a bang.  \nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every \nroom above, and every cask in the wine-merchant’s cellars below, \nappeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was \nnot a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and \nwalked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: t rimming his \ncandle as he went.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 17 \nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good \nold flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I \nmean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it \nbroadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door \ntowards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width \nfor that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge \nthought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him i n the \ngloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn’t have lighted \nthe entry too well, so you may suppose that it  was pretty dark with \nScrooge’s dip.  \nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, \nand Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, h e walked \nthrough his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough \nrecollection of the face to desire to do that.  \nSitting-room, b ed-room, lumber-room. All as they should b e. \nNobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the \ngrate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge \nhad a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody \nin the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a \nsuspicious attitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-\nguard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a \npoker.  \nQuite satisfied, h e c losed h is door, and locked h imself in; \ndouble-locked h imself in, which was not his custom. Thus s ecured \nagainst surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and \nslippers, and h is nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his \ngruel.  \nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He \nwas obliged to sit close to it, and b rood ov er it, b efore he c ould \nextract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The \nfireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and \npaved all round with qu aint Dutch tiles, d esigned to illustrate the \nScriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh’s daughters, Queens \nof Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds \nlike feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea \nin butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 18 \nface of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet’s rod, \nand swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at \nfirst, with po wer to shape some picture on its s urface from t he \ndisjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of \nold Marley’s head on every one.  \n“Humbug!” said Scrooge; and walked across the room.  \nAfter several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back \nin the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, \nthat hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now \nforgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was \nwith great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that \nas he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the \noutset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and \nso did every bell in the house.  \nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed \nan hou r. The bells ceased as they had b egun, together. They were \nsucceeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person \nwere dragging a heavy chain ov er the ca sks in the wine-merchant’s \ncellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted \nhouses were described as dragging chains.  \nThe ce llar-door f lew open with a booming sound, and then h e \nheard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the \nstairs; then coming straight towards his door.  \n“It’s humbug still!” said Scrooge. “I won’t believe it.”  \nHis colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on \nthrough the heavy door, and p assed into the room before his eyes. \nUpon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, “I \nknow him; Marley’s Ghost!” and fell again. \nThe same face: t he very same. Marley in h is pigtail, u sual \nwaistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his \npigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he \ndrew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him \nlike a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-\nboxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. \nHis body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking \nthrough his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 19 \n \n \n \n \nMarley’s Ghost \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 20 \nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but \nhe had never believed it until now.  \nNo, no r did he believe it even now. Though he looked the \nphantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though \nhe felt t he chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the \nvery texture of the folded k erchief bound about it s head and chin, \nwhich wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, \nand fought against his senses.  \n“How now!” said Scrooge, caustic a nd cold as ever. “What do \nyou want with me?”  \n“Much!”—Marley’s voice, no doubt about it.  \n“Who are you?”  \n“Ask me who I was.”  \n“Who were you then?” said Scrooge, raising his voice. “You’re \nparticular, for a shade.” He was going to say “to a shade,” but \nsubstituted this, as more appropriate.  \n“In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.”  \n“Can you—can you sit down?” a sked Scrooge, looking \ndoubtfully at him.  \n“I can.”  \n“Do it, then.”  \nScrooge asked the question, b ecause he didn’t know w hether a \nghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; \nand felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the \nnecessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat down on \nthe opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.  \n“You don’t believe in me,” observed the Ghost.  \n“I don’t,” said Scrooge.  \n“What evidence would you h ave of my reality beyond that of \nyour senses?”  \n“I don’t know,” said Scrooge.  \n“Why do you doubt your senses?”  \n“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them. A slight \ndisorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be a n \nundigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb o f cheese, a \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 21 \nfragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave \nabout you, whatever you are!”  \nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he \nfeel, in h is heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he \ntried to b e smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and \nkeeping down h is terror; for the spectre’s voice disturbed the very \nmarrow in his bones.  \nTo sit, staring at t hose fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a \nmoment, would p lay, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with h im. There \nwas something very awful, too, in the spectre’s being provided with \nan infernal atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, \nbut t his was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly \nmotionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the \nhot vapour from an oven.  \n“You see this toothpick?” said Scrooge, returning quickly to the \ncharge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only \nfor a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from himself.  \n“I do,” replied the Ghost.  \n“You are not looking at it,” said Scrooge.  \n“But I see it,” said the Ghost, “notwithstanding.”  \n“Well!” returned Scrooge, “I have but to swallow this, and be for \nthe rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own \ncreation. Humbug, I tell you! humbug!”  \nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with \nsuch a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his \nchair, to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater \nwas his horror, when the phantom t aking off the bandage round its \nhead, as if it were too warm to wear in-doors, its lower jaw dropped \ndown upon its breast!  \nScrooge fell upon h is knees, and clasped h is hands before his \nface.  \n“Mercy!” he said. “Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble \nme?”  \n“Man of the worldly mind!” replied the Ghost, “do you believe \nin me or not?”  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 22 \n“I do,” said Scrooge. “I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, \nand why do they come to me?”  \n“It is required of every man,” the Ghost returned, “that the spirit \nwithin him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far \nand wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do \nso after death. It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is \nme!—and witness what it cannot share, bu t m ight have shared on  \nearth, and turned to happiness!”  \nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its \nshadowy hands.  \n“You are fettered,” said Scrooge, trembling. “Tell me why?”  \n“I wear the chain I forged in life,” replied the Ghost. “I made it \nlink by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and \nof my own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?”  \nScrooge trembled more and more.  \n“Or would you kno w,” pursued the Ghost, “the weight and \nlength of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as \nlong as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You h ave laboured on it, \nsince. It is a ponderous chain!”  \nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation o f \nfinding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron \ncable: but he could see nothing.  \n“Jacob,” he said, imploringly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. \nSpeak comfort to me, Jacob!”  \n“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes from other \nregions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to \nother kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little \nmore is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger \nanywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark \nme!—in life my spirit never r oved b eyond the narrow limits of our \nmoney-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!”  \nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to \nput his hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost \nhad said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off \nhis knees.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 23 \n“You must have been very slow about it , Jacob,” Scrooge \nobserved, in a business-like manner, though with hu mility and \ndeference.  \n“Slow!” the Ghost repeated.  \n“Seven years dead,” mused Scrooge. “And travelling all t he \ntime!”  \n“The whole time,” said the Ghost. “No rest, no peace. Incessant \ntorture of remorse.”  \n“You travel fast?” said Scrooge.  \n“On the wings of the wind,” replied the Ghost.  \n“You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven \nyears,” said Scrooge.  \nThe Ghost, on h earing this, set up another cry, and clanked its \nchain so h ideously in the dead silence of the night, that t he Ward \nwould have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.  \n“Oh! captive, bound , and doub le-ironed,” c ried the phantom, \n“not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for \nthis earth must pass into eternity before the good o f which it is \nsusceptible is all developed. Not t o kno w that any Christian spirit \nworking kindly in its little sphere, whatever it m ay be, will find its \nmortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that \nno space of r egret can make a mends for one life’s opportunity \nmisused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!”  \n“But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,” faltered \nScrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.  \n“Business!” cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. “Mankind \nwas my business. The c ommon welfare was my business; charity, \nmercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business. The \ndealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive \nocean of my business!”  \nIt held up its chain at arm’s length, as if that were the cause of all \nits unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.  \n“At this time of the rolling year,” the spectre said, “I suffer most. \nWhy did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned \ndown, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 24 \nMen to a poor abode! Were there no po or homes to which its light \nwould have conducted me!”  \nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at \nthis rate, and began to quake exceedingly.  \n“Hear me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is nearly gone.”  \n“I will,” said Scrooge. “But don ’t be hard up on me! Don’t be \nflowery, Jacob! Pray!”  \n“How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I \nmay not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.”  \nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the \nperspiration from his brow.  \n“That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost. “I am \nhere to-night t o warn you, that you h ave yet a c hance a nd hope of \nescaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.”  \n“You were a lways a good friend to me,” said Scrooge. \n“Thank’ee!”  \n“You will be haunted,” resumed the Ghost, “by Three Spirits.”  \nScrooge’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s had \ndone.  \n“Is that t he c hance and hop e you mentioned, Jacob?” he \ndemanded, in a faltering voice.  \n“It is.”  \n“I—I think I’d rather not,” said Scrooge.  \n“Without their visits,” said the Ghost, “you cannot hope to shun \nthe path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.”  \n“Couldn’t I take ’em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?” hinted \nScrooge.  \n“Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third \nupon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to \nvibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, \nyou remember what has passed between us!”  \nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from \nthe table, and bound it round its head, as before. Scrooge knew this, \nby the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought \ntogether by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 25 \nfound h is s upernatural visitor confronting h im i n an erect attitude, \nwith its chain wound over and about its arm.  \nThe apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it \ntook, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached \nit, it was wide open.  \nIt beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were \nwithin two p aces of each o ther, Marley’s Ghost held up its hand, \nwarning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.  \nNot so much in ob edience, as in surprise a nd fear: for on the \nraising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; \nincoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly \nsorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a \nmoment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, \ndark night.  \n\nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 26 \nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He \nlooked out.  \nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in \nrestless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore \nchains like Marley’s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty \ngovernments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been \npersonally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar \nwith one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe \nattached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a \nwretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a doorstep. \nThe misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, \nfor good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever. \nWhether these c reatures faded into mist, o r mist enshrouded \nthem, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; \nand the night became as it had been when he walked home.  \nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the \nGhost had entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his \nown h ands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \n“Humbug!” but stopped at t he first syllable. And b eing, from t he \nemotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse \nof the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the \nlateness of the hour, much in n eed o f r epose; went straight t o b ed, \nwithout undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.  \n27 \n \n \n \nSTAVE  II \nTHE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS \n \nWHEN Scrooge a woke, it was s o d ark, that l ooking out of bed, he \ncould scarcely distinguish the transparent window from t he opaque \nwalls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness \nwith his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck \nthe four quarters. So he listened for the hour.  \nTo h is great astonishment t he heavy bell went on from six to \nseven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; t hen \nstopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was \nwrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!  \nHe touched the spring o f his repeater, to correct this most \npreposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.  \n“Why, it i sn’t possible,” said Scrooge, “that I can h ave slept \nthrough a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that \nanything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!”  \nThe idea being an alarming one, h e scrambled out of bed, and \ngroped h is way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off \nwith the sleeve o f his dressing-gown before he could see anything; \nand could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was \nstill very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of \npeople running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there \nunquestionably would have been if night had b eaten off bright day, \nand taken po ssession o f the world. This was a great relief, b ecause \n“three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer \nScrooge or his order,” and so forth, would have become a mere \nUnited States’ security if there were no days to count by.  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 28 \nScrooge went t o b ed again, and thought, and thought, and \nthought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it. The \nmore he thought, the more perplexed h e was; and the more he \nendeavoured not to think, the more he thought.  \nMarley’s Ghost bothered h im exceedingly. Every time he \nresolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, \nhis mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first \nposition, and presented the same problem t o b e worked all t hrough, \n“Was it a dream or not?”  \nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters \nmore, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned \nhim of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake \nuntil the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go \nto sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in \nhis power.  \nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced \nhe must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. \nAt length it broke upon his listening ear.  \n“Ding, dong!”  \n“A quarter past,” said Scrooge, counting.  \n“Ding, dong!”  \n“Half-past!” said Scrooge.  \n“Ding, dong!”  \n“A quarter to it,” said Scrooge.  \n“Ding, dong!”  \n“The hour itself,” said Scrooge, triumphantly, “and no thing \nelse!”  \nHe spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a \ndeep, du ll, ho llow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room \nupon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.  \nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. \nNot the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to \nwhich h is face was addressed. The c urtains of his bed were drawn \naside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found \nhimself f ace to face with the unearthly visitor who d rew them: as \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 29 \nclose to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your \nelbow.  \nIt was a strange figure—like a c hild: yet not so like a c hild as \nlike a n o ld man, v iewed through some supernatural m edium, which \ngave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being \ndiminished to a c hild’s proportions. Its hair, which hu ng about it s \nneck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had \nnot a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms \nwere very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were \nof uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, \nwere, like those upper members, b are. It wore a  tunic of the purest \nwhite; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen o f \nwhich was beautiful. It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; \nand, in singular contradiction o f that wintry emblem, h ad its dress \ntrimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, \nthat from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, \nby which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of \nits using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which \nit now held under its arm.  \nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it  with increasing \nsteadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt sparkled and \nglittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one \ninstant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its \ndistinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now \nwith twenty legs, no w a pair of legs without a head, no w a head \nwithout a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible \nin the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the very \nwonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.  \n“Are you the Spirit, sir, whose c oming was foretold to me?” \nasked Scrooge.  \n“I am!”  \nThe voice was s oft and gentle. Singularly low, as if instead of \nbeing so close beside him, it were at a distance.  \n“Who, and what are you?” Scrooge demanded.  \n“I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.”  \n“Long Past?” inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish stature.  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 30 \n“No. Your past.”  \nPerhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody \ncould have asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in \nhis cap; and begged him to be covered.  \n“What!” exclaimed the Ghost, “would you so soon put out, with \nworldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of \nthose whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole \ntrains of years to wear it low upon my brow!”  \nScrooge reverently disclaimed all i ntention to o ffend o r any \nknowledge of having wilfully “bonneted” the Spirit at any period of \nhis life. He then made bold to inquire what business brought him \nthere.  \n“Your welfare!” said the Ghost.  \nScrooge e xpressed h imself much ob liged, bu t could no t help \nthinking that a night of unbroken rest would h ave been more \nconducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it \nsaid immediately:  \n“Your reclamation, then. Take heed!”  \nIt put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by \nthe arm.  \n“Rise! and walk with me!”  \nIt would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather \nand the hour were not adapted to p edestrian pu rposes; t hat bed was \nwarm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was \nclad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that \nhe had a c old upon h im at t hat tim e. The grasp, though gentle a s a \nwoman’s hand, was not t o be resisted. He rose: but finding that the \nSpirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.  \n“I am a mortal,” Scrooge remonstrated, “and liable to fall.”  \n“Bear but a touch o f my hand there,” said the Spirit, laying it \nupon his heart, “and you shall be upheld in more than this!”  \nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and \nstood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city \nhad entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness \nand the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, \nwith snow upon the ground.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 31 \n“Good Heaven!” said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he \nlooked about him. “I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!”  \nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had \nbeen light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man’s \nsense of feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in \nthe air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and \njoys, and cares long, long, forgotten!  \n“Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon \nyour cheek?”  \nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it \nwas a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.  \n“You recollect the way?” inquired the Spirit.  \n“Remember it!” c ried Scrooge with fervour; “I could walk it \nblindfold.”  \n“Strange to h ave forgotten it for so many years!” observed the \nGhost. “Let us go on.”  \nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and \npost, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with \nits bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now \nwere seen trotting towards them with b oys upon their backs, who \ncalled to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All \nthese boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the \nbroad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to \nhear it!  \n“These are but shadows of the things that have been,” said the \nGhost. “They have no consciousness of us.”  \nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew \nand named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds \nto see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and h is heart l eap up as \nthey went past! Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them \ngive eac h other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and \nbye-ways, for their several homes! What was merry Christmas to \nScrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to \nhim?  \n“The school i s not quite deserted,” said the Ghost. “A solitary \nchild, neglected by his friends, is left there still.”  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 32 \nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.  \nThey left t he high-road, b y a well-remembered lane, and soon \napproached a mansion of dull red b rick, with a little weathercock-\nsurmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large \nhouse, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little \nused, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and \ntheir gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the \ncoach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass. Nor was it m ore \nretentive of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and \nglancing through the open doo rs of many rooms, they found them \npoorly furnished, cold, and v ast. There was an earthy savour in the \nair, a c hilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow \nwith too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat.  \nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at \nthe back o f the house. It opened b efore them, and d isclosed a long, \nbare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms \nand desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; \nand Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten \nself as he used to be.  \nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the \nmice behind the panelling, no t a drip from t he half-thawed water-\nspout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of \none despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house \ndoor, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge \nwith a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.  \nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger \nself, intent upon h is reading. Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: \nwonderfully real and distinct t o look at: stood ou tside the window, \nwith an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden \nwith wood.  \n“Why, it’s Ali Baba!” Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. “It’s dear \nold hon est Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas time, when \nyonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first \ntime, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,” said Scrooge, “and his \nwild b rother, Orson; t here they go! And what’s his name, who was \nput down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don’t you \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 33 \nsee him! And the Sultan’s Groom turned upside down by the Genii; \nthere he is upon h is head! Serve him right. I’m glad of it. What \nbusiness had he to be married to the Princess!”  \nTo hear Scrooge expending all t he earnestness of his nature on \nsuch subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and \ncrying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a \nsurprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.  \n“There’s the Parrot!” c ried Scrooge. “Green b ody and yellow \ntail, with a thing like a  lettuce growing out of the top o f his head; \nthere he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home \nagain after sailing round the island. ‘Poor Robin Crusoe, where have \nyou been, Robin Crusoe?’ The man thought he was dreaming, but he \nwasn’t. It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for \nhis life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!”  \nThen, with a rapidity of transition v ery foreign to h is usual \ncharacter, he said, in pity for his former self, “Poor boy!” and cried \nagain.  \n“I wish,” Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and \nlooking about him, after drying his eyes with h is cuff: “but it ’s too \nlate now.”  \n“What is the matter?” asked the Spirit.  \n“Nothing,” said Scrooge. “Nothing. There was a boy singing a \nChristmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him \nsomething: that’s all.”  \nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it \ndid so, “Let us see another Christmas!”  \nScrooge’s former self grew larger at t he words, and the room \nbecame a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows \ncracked; fragments of plaster f ell out of the ce iling, and the naked \nlaths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge \nknew no more than you do. He only knew that it was quite correct; \nthat everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when \nall the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.  \nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. \nScrooge looked at t he Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his \nhead, glanced anxiously towards the door.  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 34 \nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came \ndarting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, \naddressed him as her “Dear, dear brother.”  \n“I have come to bring you home, dear brother!” said the child, \nclapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. “To bring you \nhome, home, home!”  \n“Home, little Fan?” returned the boy.  \n“Yes!” said the child, brimful of glee. “Home, for good and all. \nHome, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, \nthat home’s like Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night \nwhen I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if \nyou might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a \ncoach to bring you. And you’re to be a man!” said the child, opening \nher eyes, “and are never to come back h ere; but first, we’re to b e \ntogether all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the \nworld.”  \n“You are quite a woman, little Fan!” exclaimed the boy.  \nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; \nbut being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace \nhim. Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards \nthe door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.  \nA terrible voice in the hall cried, “Bring down Master Scrooge’s \nbox, there!” and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who \nglared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw \nhim into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then \nconveyed h im and h is s ister into the veriest old well of a shivering \nbest-parlour that ever was s een, where the maps upon the wall, and \nthe ce lestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with \ncold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block \nof curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those \ndainties to the young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre \nservant to offer a glass of “something” to the postboy, who answered \nthat he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had \ntasted before, he had rather not. Master Scrooge’s trunk being by this \ntime tied on  to the top o f the c haise, the c hildren b ade the \nschoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 35 \ndown the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and \nsnow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.  \n“Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have \nwithered,” said the Ghost. “But she had a large heart!”  \n“So she had,” cried Scrooge. “You’re right. I will not gainsay it, \nSpirit. God forbid!”  \n“She died a woman,” said the Ghost, “and had, as I think, \nchildren.”  \n“One child,” Scrooge returned.  \n“True,” said the Ghost. “Your nephew!”  \nScrooge seemed un easy in h is mind; and answered briefly, \n“Yes.”  \nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, \nthey were now in the busy thoroughfares of a c ity, where shadowy \npassengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches \nbattled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It \nwas made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it \nwas Christmas time a gain; but it was evening, and the streets were \nlighted up.  \nThe Ghost stopped at a ce rtain warehouse door, and asked \nScrooge if he knew it.  \n“Know it!” said Scrooge. “Was I apprenticed here!”  \nThey went i n. At sight of an o ld gentleman in a Welsh wig, \nsitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller \nhe must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in \ngreat excitement:  \n“Why, it’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it ’s Fezziwig alive \nagain!”  \nOld Fezziwig laid do wn h is pen, and looked up at t he c lock, \nwhich pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his \ncapacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his \norgan of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, \njovial voice:  \n“Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!”  \nScrooge’s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, \naccompanied by his fellow-’prentice.  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 36 \n“Dick Wilkins, to b e sure!” said Scrooge to the Ghost. “Bless \nme, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. \nPoor Dick! Dear, dear!”  \n“Yo ho, my boys!” said Fezziwig. “No more work to-night. \nChristmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let’s have the shutters \nup,” cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, “before a man \ncan say Jack Robinson!”  \nYou wouldn’t believe how those two fellows went at it ! They \ncharged into the street with the shutters—one, two, three—had ’em up \nin their places—four, five, six—barred ’em and pinned ’em—seven, \neight, n ine—and came back b efore you could h ave got t o twelve, \npanting like race-horses.  \n“Hilli-ho!” cried o ld Fezziwig, skipping down from t he high \ndesk, with wonderful agility. “Clear away, my lads, and let’s have lots \nof room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!”  \nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn’t have c leared \naway, or couldn’t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It \nwas done in a minute. Every movable was packed o ff, as if it were \ndismissed from public life for evermore; t he floor was s wept and \nwatered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and \nthe warehouse was as s nug, and warm, and dry, and b right a ball-\nroom, as you would desire to see upon a winter’s night.  \nIn came a  fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty \ndesk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. \nIn came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three \nMiss Fezziwigs, b eaming and lovable. In came the six young \nfollowers whose hearts they broke. In came a ll t he young men and \nwomen employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with h er \ncousin, the baker. In came the c ook, with h er brother’s particular \nfriend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was \nsuspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide \nhimself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to \nhave had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, one after \nanother; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, \nsome pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. \nAway they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 37 \nagain the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round \nin v arious s tages of affectionate grouping; old top couple a lways \nturning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as \nsoon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to \nhelp them! When this result was brought about, o ld Fezziwig, \nclapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, “Well done!” and the \nfiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided \nfor that purpose. But scorning rest, upon h is reappearance, h e \ninstantly began again, though there were no d ancers yet, as if the \nother fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he \nwere a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.  \nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more \ndances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a \ngreat piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, \nand there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of \nthe e vening came a fter the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler ( an \nartful dog, mind! The sort of man who knew his business better than \nyou or I could have told it him!) struck up “Sir Roger de Coverley.” \nThen o ld Fezziwig stood ou t t o d ance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top \ncouple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or \nfour and twenty pair of partners; people who were not t o b e trifled \nwith; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking. \nBut i f they had b een twice a s many—ah, four times—old \nFezziwig would h ave been a match for them, and so would Mrs. \nFezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense \nof the term. If that’s not high praise, tell me higher, and I’ll use it. A \npositive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig’s calves. They shone in \nevery part of the dance like moons. You couldn’t have predicted, at \nany given time, what would have become of them next. And when old \nFezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance; advance \nand retire, bo th h ands to your partner, b ow and curtsey, corkscrew, \nthread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig “cut”—cut \nso deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his \nfeet again without a stagger.  \n \n \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 38 \n \n \n \n \nMr. Fezziwig’s Ball \n \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 39 \nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. \nand Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, \nand shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went \nout, wished h im or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had \nretired but the two ’prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the \ncheerful voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which \nwere under a counter in the back-shop.  \nDuring the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out \nof his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former \nself. He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed \neverything, and und erwent t he strangest agitation. It was not until \nnow, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned \nfrom them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that \nit was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very \nclear.  \n“A small m atter,” said the Ghost, “to make these silly folks so \nfull of gratitude.”  \n“Small!” echoed Scrooge.  \nThe Spirit signed to h im t o listen to the two apprentices, who \nwere pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had \ndone so, said,  \n“Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal \nmoney: t hree or f our perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this \npraise?”  \n“It isn’t that,” said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking \nunconsciously like his former, not his latter, self. “It isn’t that, Spirit. \nHe has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service \nlight or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in \nwords and looks; i n things s o slight and insignificant that it i s \nimpossible to add and count ’em up: what t hen? The happiness he \ngives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.”  \nHe felt the Spirit’s glance, and stopped.  \n“What is the matter?” asked the Ghost.  \n“Nothing particular,” said Scrooge.  \n“Something, I think?” the Ghost insisted.  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 40 \n“No,” said Scrooge, “No. I should like to be able to say a word \nor two to my clerk just now. That’s all.”  \nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to \nthe wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the \nopen air.  \n“My time grows short,” observed the Spirit. “Quick!”  \nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could \nsee, bu t it produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw \nhimself. He was older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had \nnot the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear \nthe signs of care a nd avarice. There was an eager, g reedy, restless \nmotion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and \nwhere the shadow of the growing tree would fall.  \nHe was not alone, bu t sat by the side of a fair young g irl i n a \nmourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the \nlight that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.  \n“It matters little,” she said, softly. “To you, very little. Another \nidol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to \ncome, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.”  \n“What Idol has displaced you?” he rejoined.  \n“A golden one.”  \n“This is the even-handed dealing of the world!” he said. “There \nis nothing on which it is s o h ard as poverty; and there is nothing it \nprofesses to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!”  \n“You fear the world too much,” she answered, gently. “All your \nother hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of \nits sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by \none, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?”  \n“What then?” he retorted. “Even if I have grown so much wiser, \nwhat then? I am not changed towards you.”  \nShe shook her head.  \n“Am I?”  \n“Our contract i s an o ld on e. It was made when we were both \npoor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our \nworldly fortune by our patient i ndustry. You are changed. When it \nwas made, you were another man.”  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 41 \n“I was a boy,” he said impatiently.  \n“Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,” she \nreturned. “I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in \nheart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how \nkeenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I have \nthought of it, and can release you.”  \n“Have I ever sought release?”  \n“In words. No. Never.”  \n“In what, then?”  \n“In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere \nof life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love \nof any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between \nus,” said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; “tell \nme, would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!”  \nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of \nhimself. But he said with a struggle, “You think not.”  \n“I would gladly think o therwise if I could,” she a nswered, \n“Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this, I know how \nstrong and irresistible it must be. But i f you were free to-day, to-\nmorrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a \ndowerless girl—you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh \neverything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false \nenough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your \nrepentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. \nWith a full heart, for the love of him you once were.”  \nHe was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she \nresumed.  \n“You may—the memory of what is past half makes me hope you \nwill—have pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss \nthe recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it \nhappened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have \nchosen!”  \nShe left him, and they parted.  \n“Spirit!” said Scrooge, “show me no more! Conduct me home. \nWhy do you delight to torture me?”  \n“One shadow more!” exclaimed the Ghost.  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 42 \n“No more!” cried Scrooge. “No more. I don’t wish to see it. \nShow me no more!”  \nBut t he relentless Ghost pinioned h im i n both his arms, and \nforced him to observe what happened next.  \nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or \nhandsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful \nyoung g irl, so like that last t hat Scrooge believed it was the same, \nuntil he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter. \nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more \nchildren there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; \nand, un like the c elebrated h erd in the poem, they were not forty \nchildren conducting themselves like one, b ut every child was \nconducting itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious \nbeyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother \nand d aughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the \nlatter, soon b eginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the \nyoung brigands most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be \none of them! Though I never could h ave been so rude, no, no ! I  \nwouldn’t for the wealth o f all t he world have c rushed that braided \nhair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn’t have \nplucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring \nher waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn’t have done \nit; I should h ave e xpected my arm t o h ave grown round it for a \npunishment, and n ever come straight again. And yet I should h ave \ndearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, \nthat she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of \nher downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves \nof hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, \nI should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a \nchild, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.  \nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush \nimmediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress \nwas borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just \nin time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden \nwith Christmas toys and p resents. Then the shouting and the \nstruggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 43 \nThe scaling him with chairs for ladders to d ive into h is pockets, \ndespoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug \nhim round h is neck, po mmel his back, and kick h is legs in \nirrepressible affection! The shouts of wonder and delight with which \nthe development of every package was received! The terrible \nannouncement t hat t he baby had b een taken in the ac t of putting a \ndoll’s frying-pan into h is mouth, and was more than suspected o f \nhaving swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter! The \nimmense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and gratitude, \nand ecstasy! They are all i ndescribable a like. It is enough that by \ndegrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by \none stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, \nand so subsided.  \nAnd no w Scrooge looked on more a ttentively than ever, when \nthe master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, \nsat down with her and h er mother at his own fireside; and when he \nthought t hat such another creature, qu ite a s graceful and as full of \npromise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the \nhaggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.  \n“Belle,” said the husband, turning to h is wife with a smile, “I \nsaw an old friend of yours this afternoon.”  \n“Who was it?”  \n“Guess!”  \n“How can I? Tut, don’t I know?” she added in the same breath, \nlaughing as he laughed. “Mr. Scrooge.”  \n“Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was \nnot shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing \nhim. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat \nalone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.”  \n“Spirit!” said Scrooge in a broken voice, “remove me from this \nplace.”  \n“I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,” \nsaid the Ghost. “That they are what they are, do not blame me!”  \n“Remove me!” Scrooge exclaimed, “I cannot bear it!”  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 44 \nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it l ooked upon h im \nwith a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all \nthe faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.  \n“Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!”  \nIn the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost \nwith no v isible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any \neffort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that it s light was burning \nhigh and bright; and d imly connecting that with its influence over \nhim, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it \ndown upon its head.  \nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its \nwhole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he \ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken \nflood upon the ground.  \nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an \nirresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bed-room. He \ngave the ca p a parting squeeze, in which h is hand relaxed; and h ad \nbarely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep. \n \n \n45 \n \n \n \nSTAVE  III \nTHE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS \n \nAWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up \nin bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told \nthat t he bell was again upon  the stroke of One. He felt t hat he was \nrestored to consciousness in the right nick o f time, for the e special \npurpose of holding a conference with the second messenger \ndespatched to him through Jacob Marley’s intervention. But, finding \nthat he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of \nhis curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one \naside with his own hands, and lying down again, established a sharp \nlook-out all round the bed. For, he wished to challenge the Spirit on \nthe moment of its appearance, and d id no t wish to b e taken by \nsurprise, and made nervous.  \nGentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on \nbeing acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the \ntime-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by \nobserving that t hey are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to \nmanslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doub t, there lies \na tolerably wide a nd comprehensive range of subjects. Without \nventuring for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don’t mind calling on \nyou to believe that he was ready for a good broad field o f strange \nappearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would \nhave astonished him very much.  \nNow, b eing prepared for almost anything, h e was not by any \nmeans prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck \nOne, and no shape a ppeared, he was taken with a violent fit of \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 46 \ntrembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hou r went by, \nyet nothing came. All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and \ncentre of a blaze of r uddy light, which streamed upon it when the \nclock p roclaimed the hour; and which, b eing only light, was more \nalarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what \nit m eant, o r would be a t; and was s ometimes apprehensive that he \nmight be a t t hat very moment an interesting case of spontaneous \ncombustion, without having the consolation o f knowing it. At last, \nhowever, he began to think—as you or I would have thought at first; \nfor it i s always the person no t i n the predicament who kno ws what \nought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it \ntoo—at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this \nghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further \ntracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking full possession of his \nmind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door.  \nThe moment Scrooge’s hand was on the lock, a strange voice \ncalled him by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.  \nIt was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had \nundergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so \nhung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part \nof which, bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, \nmistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors \nhad been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the \nchimney, as that dull petrification o f a hearth h ad n ever known in \nScrooge’s time, or Marley’s, or for many and many a winter season \ngone. Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, \ngeese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long \nwreaths of sausages, mince-pies, p lum-puddings, b arrels of oysters, \nred-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious \npears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that \nmade the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon \nthis couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing \ntorch, in shape not unlike Plenty’s horn, and h eld it up, h igh up, to \nshed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.  \n“Come in!” e xclaimed the Ghost. “Come in! and kno w me \nbetter, man!”  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 47 \n \n \nScrooge’s Third Visitor \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 48 \nScrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He \nwas not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit’s eyes \nwere clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.  \n“I am t he Ghost of Christmas Present,” said the Spirit. “Look \nupon me!”  \nScrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in o ne simple green \nrobe, o r mantle, bo rdered with white fur. This garment hung so \nloosely on the figure, that it s capacious breast was bare, as if \ndisdaining to b e warded o r concealed by any artifice. Its feet, \nobservable beneath the a mple folds of the garment, were a lso b are; \nand on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here \nand there with shining icicles. Its dark b rown curls were long and \nfree; free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery \nvoice, its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round \nits middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the \nancient sheath was eaten up with rust. \n“You h ave never seen the like of me before!” exclaimed the \nSpirit.  \n“Never,” Scrooge made answer to it.  \n“Have never walked forth with the younger members of my \nfamily; m eaning (for I am very y oung) my elder brothers born in \nthese later years?” pursued the Phantom.  \n“I don’t t hink I have,” said Scrooge. “I am afraid I have not. \nHave you had many brothers, Spirit?”  \n“More than eighteen hundred,” said the Ghost.  \n“A tremendous family to provide for!” muttered Scrooge.  \nThe Ghost of Christmas Present rose.  \n“Spirit,” said Scrooge submissively, “conduct m e where you \nwill. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which \nis working now. To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit \nby it.”  \n“Touch my robe!”  \nScrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.  \nHolly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, \nbrawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch, \nall vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 49 \nhour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning, \nwhere (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk \nand no t unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the \npavement i n front of their dwellings, and from t he tops of their \nhouses, whence it was mad d elight t o the boys to see it come \nplumping down into the road below, and splitting into artificial little \nsnow-storms.  \nThe house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, \ncontrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and \nwith the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had b een \nploughed up in d eep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and \nwaggons; furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of \ntimes where the great streets branched o ff; and made intricate \nchannels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky \nwas gloomy, and the shortest streets were c hoked up with a dingy \nmist, half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a \nshower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great Britain had, by \none consent, caught fire, and were blazing away to their dear hearts’ \ncontent. There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, \nand yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that t he c learest \nsummer air and b rightest summer sun might have e ndeavoured to \ndiffuse in vain.  \nFor, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were \njovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, \nand no w and then exchanging a facetious s nowball—better-natured \nmissile far than many a wordy jest—laughing heartily if it went right \nand not less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers’ shops were still \nhalf open, and the fruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were \ngreat, round, po t-bellied b askets of chestnuts, shaped like the \nwaistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling \nout i nto the street i n their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, \nbrown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of \ntheir growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from t heir shelves in \nwanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at \nthe hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples, clustered high in \nblooming pyramids; t here were bunches of grapes, made, in the \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 50 \nshopkeepers’ benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that \npeople’s mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of \nfilberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks \namong the woods, and p leasant shufflings ankle deep through \nwithered leaves; t here were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, \nsetting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great \ncompactness of their juicy persons, u rgently entreating and \nbeseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. \nThe very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a \nbowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared \nto kno w that t here was something going on ; and, to a fish, went \ngasping round and round their little world in slow and p assionless \nexcitement.  \nThe Grocers’! oh, the Grocers’! nearly closed, with perhaps two \nshutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was \nnot alone that t he scales descending on the c ounter made a merry \nsound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that \nthe ca nisters were rattled up and do wn like juggling tricks, o r even \nthat the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, \nor even that t he raisins were so plentiful and rare, the a lmonds s o \nextremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other \nspices s o d elicious, the candied fruits s o caked and spotted with \nmolten sugar as to make the c oldest l ookers-on feel faint and \nsubsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or \nthat t he French p lums blushed in modest t artness from t heir highly-\ndecorated bo xes, o r that everything was good to eat and in its \nChristmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in \nthe hopeful promise of the day, that t hey tumbled up against each \nother at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their \npurchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and \ncommitted hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; \nwhile the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that t he \npolished h earts with which they fastened their aprons behind might \nhave been their own, worn ou tside for general i nspection, and for \nChristmas daws to peck at if they chose.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 51 \nBut soon the steeples called good people a ll, to church and \nchapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best \nclothes, and with their gayest faces. And at t he same time there \nemerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, \ninnumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers’ shops. The \nsight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, \nfor he stood with Scrooge beside him i n a baker’s doorway, and \ntaking off the c overs as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on \ntheir dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon k ind o f \ntorch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some \ndinner-carriers who h ad jostled each o ther, h e shed a few drops of \nwater on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly. \nFor they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so \nit was! God love it, so it was!  \nIn time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet \nthere was a genial shadowing forth of all t hese dinners and the \nprogress of their cooking, in the thawed b lotch o f wet above eac h \nbaker’s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its s tones were \ncooking too.  \n“Is there a peculiar f lavour in what you sprinkle from your \ntorch?” asked Scrooge.  \n“There is. My own.”  \n“Would it apply to any kind o f dinner on this day?” a sked \nScrooge.  \n“To any kindly given. To a poor one most.”  \n“Why to a poor one most?” asked Scrooge.  \n“Because it needs it most.”  \n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, after a moment’s thought, “I wonder you, \nof all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp \nthese people’s opportunities of innocent enjoyment.”  \n“I!” cried the Spirit.  \n“You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh \nday, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,” said \nScrooge. “Wouldn’t you?”  \n“I!” cried the Spirit.  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 52 \n“You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?” said \nScrooge. “And it comes to the same thing.”  \n“I seek!” exclaimed the Spirit.  \n“Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at \nleast in that of your family,” said Scrooge.  \n“There a re some upon this earth o f yours,” returned the Spirit, \n“who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, \nill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as \nstrange to u s and all our kith and k in, as if they had n ever lived. \nRemember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.”  \nScrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as \nthey had been b efore, into the suburbs of the town. It was a \nremarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the \nbaker’s), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, h e c ould \naccommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood \nbeneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, \nas it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.  \nAnd perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing \noff this power of his, o r else it was his own k ind, generous, h earty \nnature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to \nScrooge’s clerk’s; for there he went, and took Scrooge with h im, \nholding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, \nand stopped to b less Bob Cratchit’s dwelling with the sprinkling of \nhis torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen “Bob” a-week himself; he \npocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and \nyet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!  \nThen up  rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit’s wife, dressed ou t but \npoorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap \nand make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted \nby Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; \nwhile Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan o f \npotatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob’s \nprivate property, conferred upon h is s on and h eir in honou r of the \nday) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and \nyearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks. And no w two \nsmaller Cratchits, b oy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 53 \noutside the baker’s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their \nown; and b asking in luxurious thoughts of sage a nd on ion, these \nyoung Cratchits danced about t he table, and exalted Master Peter \nCratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly \nchoked h im) blew the fire, un til t he slow potatoes bubbling up,  \nknocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.  \n“What has ever got your precious father then?” said Mrs. \nCratchit. “And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn’t as late last \nChristmas Day by half-an-hour?”  \n“Here’s Martha, mother!” said a girl, appearing as she spoke.  \n“Here’s M artha, mother!” cried the two young Cratchits. \n“Hurrah! There’s such a goose, Martha!”  \n“Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!” said \nMrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and \nbonnet for her with officious zeal.  \n“We’d a deal of work to finish up last night,” replied the girl, \n“and had to clear away this morning, mother!”  \n“Well! Never mind so long as you are come,” said Mrs. Cratchit. \n“Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless \nye!”  \n“No, no! There’s father coming,” cried the two young Cratchits, \nwho were everywhere at once. “Hide, Martha, hide!”  \nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at \nleast t hree feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, h anging down \nbefore him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look \nseasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he \nbore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!  \n“Why, where’s our Martha?” cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.  \n“Not coming,” said Mrs. Cratchit.  \n“Not coming!” said Bob, with a sudden d eclension in h is high \nspirits; for he had been Tim’s blood horse all t he way from church, \nand had come home rampant. “Not coming upon Christmas Day!”  \nMartha didn’t li ke to see him disappointed, if it were only in \njoke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and \nran into h is arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 54 \nand bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding \nsinging in the copper.  \n“And how did little Tim behave?” asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she \nhad rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to \nhis heart’s content.  \n“As good as gold,” said Bob, “and better. Somehow he gets \nthoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things \nyou ever heard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people \nsaw him i n the c hurch, because he was a c ripple, and it mi ght be \npleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame \nbeggars walk, and blind men see.”  \nBob’s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled \nmore when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.  \nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came \nTiny Tim before a nother word was s poken, escorted by his brother \nand sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his \ncuffs—as if, poo r fellow, they were capable of being made more \nshabby—compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, \nand stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master \nPeter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, \nwith which they soon returned in high procession.  \nSuch a bustle e nsued that you might have thought a goose the \nrarest of all birds; a feathered ph enomenon, to which a black swan \nwas a matter of course—and in truth it was something very like it in \nthat house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little \nsaucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with \nincredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the a pple-sauce; \nMartha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny \ncorner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, \nnot forgetting themselves, and mounting g uard upon their posts, \ncrammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose \nbefore their turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and \ngrace was s aid. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as M rs. \nCratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, p repared to \nplunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected \ngush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 55 \nthe board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, \nbeat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!  \nThere never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t believe there \never was s uch a goose c ooked. Its tenderness and flavour, size a nd \ncheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked ou t by \napple-sauce a nd mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner f or the \nwhole family; indeed, as M rs. Cratchit said with great delight \n(surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn’t ate it \nall at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits \nin p articular, were steeped in sage a nd on ion to the eyebrows! But \nnow, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the \nroom alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to take the pudding up \nand bring it in.  \nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break \nin turning out! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of \nthe back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose—a \nsupposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts \nof horrors were supposed.  \nHallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. \nA smell li ke a washing-day! That was the c loth. A smell li ke a n \neating-house a nd a pastrycook’s next door to each o ther, with a \nlaundress’s next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute \nMrs. Cratchit entered—flushed, bu t smiling proudly—with the \npudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half \nof half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly \nstuck into the top.  \nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that \nhe regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since \ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that now the weight was off her \nmind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of \nflour. Everybody had something to say about it , bu t nobody said o r \nthought it was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have \nbeen flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at \nsuch a thing.  \nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth \nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 56 \nand considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, \nand a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family \ndrew round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning \nhalf a one; and at Bob Cratchit’s elbow stood the family display of \nglass. Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.  \nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden \ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, \nwhile the c hestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked no isily. Then \nBob proposed:  \n“A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!”  \nWhich all the family re-echoed.  \n“God bless us every one!” said Tiny Tim, the last of all.  \nHe sat very close to h is father’s side upon h is little stool. Bob \nheld h is withered little hand in h is, as if he loved the c hild, and \nwished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken \nfrom him.  \n“Spirit,” said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, \n“tell me if Tiny Tim will live.”  \n“I see a vacant seat,” replied the Ghost, “in the poor chimney-\ncorner, and a c rutch without an o wner, carefully preserved. If these \nshadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.”  \n“No, no, ” said Scrooge. “Oh, no, k ind Spirit! say he will be \nspared.”  \n“If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of \nmy race,” returned the Ghost, “will find him here. What then? If he be \nlike to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”  \nScrooge hung his head to h ear his own words quoted by the \nSpirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.  \n“Man,” said the Ghost, “if man you b e in h eart, no t adamant, \nforbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus \nis, and Where it i s. Will you decide what men shall li ve, what men \nshall die? It m ay be, that i n the sight of Heaven, you are more \nworthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man’s child. \nOh God! to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much \nlife among his hungry brothers in the dust!”  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 57 \nScrooge bent before the Ghost’s rebuke, and trembling cast his \neyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on h earing his \nown name.  \n“Mr. Scrooge!” said Bob; “I’ll give you Mr. Scrooge, the \nFounder of the Feast!”  \n“The Founder of the Feast i ndeed!” c ried Mrs. Cratchit, \nreddening. “I wish I had him here. I’d give him a piece of my mind to \nfeast upon, and I hope he’d have a good appetite for it.”  \n“My dear,” said Bob, “the children! Christmas Day.”  \n“It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,” said she, “on which one \ndrinks the health o f such an od ious, stingy, h ard, un feeling man as \nMr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than \nyou do, poor fellow!”  \n“My dear,” was Bob’s mild answer, “Christmas Day.”  \n“I’ll drink h is health for your sake a nd the Day’s,” said Mrs. \nCratchit, “not for his. Long life to h im! A merry Christmas and a \nhappy new year! He’ll be very merry and v ery happy, I have no \ndoubt!”  \nThe c hildren drank the toast after her. It was the first of their \nproceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but \nhe didn’t care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of the family. \nThe mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was \nnot dispelled for full five minutes.  \nAfter it h ad passed away, they were ten times merrier than \nbefore, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with. \nBob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master \nPeter, which would b ring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence \nweekly. The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of \nPeter’s being a man of business; and Peter himself looked \nthoughtfully at t he fire from between h is collars, as if he were \ndeliberating what particular investments he should favour when he \ncame into the receipt of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a \npoor apprentice at a milliner’s, then told them what kind of work she \nhad to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she \nmeant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow \nbeing a holiday she passed at home. Also how she had seen a countess \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 58 \nand a lord some days before, and how the lord “was much about as \ntall as Peter;” a t which Peter pulled up h is collars s o h igh that you \ncouldn’t have seen his head if you had been there. All this time the \nchestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had \na song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who \nhad a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.  \nThere was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a \nhandsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far \nfrom being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might \nhave known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker’s. But, \nthey were happy, grateful, p leased with on e a nother, and contented \nwith the time; and when they faded, and looked h appier yet i n the \nbright sprinklings of the Spirit’s torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye \nupon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.  \nBy this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and \nas Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the \nroaring fires in k itchens, p arlours, and all sorts of r ooms, was \nwonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a \ncosy dinner, with ho t plates baking through and through before the \nfire, and deep red curtains, ready to b e drawn to shut out cold and \ndarkness. There all the children of the house were running out into the \nsnow to meet their married sisters, b rothers, cousins, un cles, aunts, \nand b e the first t o greet t hem. Here, again, were shadows on the \nwindow-blind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome \ngirls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped \nlightly off to some near neighbour’s house; where, woe upon the \nsingle man who saw them enter—artful witches, well they knew it—\nin a glow!  \nBut, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way \nto friendly gatherings, you might have thought t hat no on e was at \nhome to give them welcome when they got t here, instead o f every \nhouse expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high. \nBlessings on it, how the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of \nbreast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, ou tpouring, \nwith a generous hand, its bright and h armless mirth on everything \nwithin its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 59 \ndusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the \nevening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though \nlittle kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas!  \nAnd now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood \nupon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone \nwere ca st about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and \nwater spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but \nfor the frost t hat held it prisoner; and no thing g rew but m oss and \nfurze, and coarse rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left \na streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, \nlike a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the \nthick gloom of darkest night.  \n“What place is this?” asked Scrooge.  \n“A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the \nearth,” returned the Spirit. “But they know me. See!”  \nA light shone from t he window of a hut, and swiftly they \nadvanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they \nfound a c heerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An o ld, \nold man and woman, with their children and their children’s children, \nand another generation b eyond that, all decked out gaily in their \nholiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose a bove the \nhowling of the wind upon the barren waste, was s inging them a \nChristmas song—it had been a very old song when he was a boy—\nand from time to time they all joined in the chorus. So surely as they \nraised their voices, the old man got quite blithe a nd loud; and so \nsurely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.  \nThe Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and \npassing on above the moor, sped—whither? Not to sea? To sea. To \nScrooge’s horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful \nrange of r ocks, behind them; and h is ears were deafened by the \nthundering o f water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the \ndreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to und ermine the \nearth.  \nBuilt upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from \nshore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, \nthere stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 60 \nbase, and storm-birds—born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-\nweed of the water—rose a nd fell about it , like the waves they \nskimmed.  \nBut even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, \nthat t hrough the loophole in the thick stone wall shed ou t a ray of \nbrightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough \ntable a t which they sat, they wished each o ther Merry Christmas in \ntheir can o f grog; and one of them: t he e lder, too, with h is face all \ndamaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old \nship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself.  \nAgain the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea—on, \non—until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they \nlighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the \nlook-out i n the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly \nfigures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a \nChristmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath \nto h is companion o f some bygone Christmas Day, with ho meward \nhopes belonging to it. And every man on bo ard, waking or sleeping, \ngood or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on \nany day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; \nand had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known \nthat they delighted to remember him.  \nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning \nof the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on \nthrough the lonely darkness over an unkno wn abyss, whose depths \nwere secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, \nwhile thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much g reater \nsurprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew’s and to find \nhimself in a bright, d ry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing \nsmiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving \naffability!  \n“Ha, ha!” laughed Scrooge’s nephew. “Ha, ha, ha!”  \nIf you should h appen, by any unlikely chance, to kno w a man \nmore blest in a laugh than Scrooge’s nephew, all I can say is, I should \nlike to kno w him t oo. Introduce him t o me, and I’ll cultivate his \nacquaintance.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 61 \nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while \nthere is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world \nso irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When \nScrooge’s nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his \nhead, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: \nScrooge’s niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their \nassembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.  \n“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!”  \n“He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!” c ried \nScrooge’s nephew. “He believed it too!”  \n“More shame for him, Fred!” said Scrooge’s niece, indignantly. \nBless those women; t hey never do anything by halves. They are \nalways in earnest.  \nShe was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled, \nsurprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made \nto be kissed—as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about \nher chin, that m elted into on e a nother when she laughed; and the \nsunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little c reature’s head. \nAltogether she was what you would h ave ca lled p rovoking, you \nknow; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.  \n“He’s a comical old fellow,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that’s the \ntruth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry \ntheir own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.”  \n“I’m sure he is very rich, Fred,” hinted Scrooge’s niece. “At least \nyou always tell me so.”  \n“What of that, my dear!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “His wealth is \nof no u se to h im. He don’t do any good with it. He don’t m ake \nhimself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the satisfaction of thinking—\nha, ha, ha!—that he is ever going to benefit US with it.”  \n“I have no p atience with h im,” observed Scrooge’s niece. \nScrooge’s niece’s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same \nopinion.  \n“Oh, I have!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “I am sorry for him; I \ncouldn’t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims! \nHimself, always. Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 62 \nwon’t come and dine with us. What’s the consequence? He don’t lose \nmuch of a dinner.”  \n“Indeed, I think h e loses a very good d inner,” interrupted \nScrooge’s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be \nallowed to h ave been competent j udges, b ecause they had just had \ndinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the \nfire, by lamplight.  \n“Well! I’m very glad to h ear it,” said Scrooge’s nephew, \n“because I haven’t great faith in these young housekeepers. What do \nyou say, Topper?”  \nTopper had clearly got his eye upon on e of Scrooge’s niece’s \nsisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who \nhad no right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge’s \nniece’s sister—the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with \nthe roses—blushed.  \n“Do go on, Fred,” said Scrooge’s niece, clapping her hands. “He \nnever finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!”  \nScrooge’s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was \nimpossible to k eep the infection o ff; t hough the plump sister tried \nhard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously \nfollowed.  \n“I was only going to say,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that t he \nconsequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with \nus, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do \nhim no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can \nfind in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty \nchambers. I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he \nlikes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but \nhe can’t help thinking better of it—I defy him—if he finds me going \nthere, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how \nare you? If it only puts him i n the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty \npounds, that’s something; and I think I shook him yesterday.”  \nIt was their turn to laugh no w at t he notion o f his s haking \nScrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and no t m uch caring \nwhat they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged \nthem in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 63 \nAfter tea, they had some music. For they were a musical family, \nand knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I \ncan assure you: especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass \nlike a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get \nred in the face over it. Scrooge’s niece played well upon the harp; and \nplayed among other tunes a simple little a ir ( a mere nothing: you \nmight learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to \nthe c hild who fetched Scrooge from t he boarding-school, as he had \nbeen reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past. When this s train o f \nmusic sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon \nhis mind; he softened more a nd more; and thought t hat i f he c ould \nhave listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the \nkindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without \nresorting to the sexton’s spade that buried Jacob Marley.  \nBut they didn’t devote the whole evening to music. After a while \nthey played at forfeits; for it i s good to b e c hildren sometimes, and \nnever better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child \nhimself. Stop! There was first a game at blind-man’s buff. Of course \nthere was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I \nbelieve he had eyes in h is boots. My opinion is, that it was a done \nthing between him and Scrooge’s nephew; and that t he Ghost of \nChristmas Present knew it. The way he went after that plump sister in \nthe lace tucker, was an outrage on the c redulity of human n ature. \nKnocking do wn the fire-irons, tumbling ov er the c hairs, bu mping \nagainst t he piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever \nshe went, there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was. \nHe wouldn’t catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as \nsome of them did), o n purpose, h e would h ave made a  feint of \nendeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your \nunderstanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of \nthe plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn’t fair; and it really \nwas not. But when at last, h e caught her; when, in spite of all her \nsilken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a \ncorner whence there was no escape; t hen h is conduct was the most \nexecrable. For his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it \nwas necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 64 \nof her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain \nchain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her \nopinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so \nvery confidential together, behind the curtains.  \nScrooge’s niece was not one of the blind-man’s buff party, but \nwas made c omfortable with a large c hair and a footstool, in a snug \ncorner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she \njoined in the forfeits, and loved h er love to admiration with all t he \nletters of the a lphabet. Likewise at t he game of How, When, and \nWhere, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge’s nephew, \nbeat her sisters hollow: t hough they were sharp girls too, as Topper \ncould h ave told you. There might have been twenty people there, \nyoung and o ld, bu t t hey all played, and so d id Scrooge; for wholly \nforgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice \nmade no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess \nquite loud, and v ery often guessed qu ite right, too; for the sharpest \nneedle, b est Whitechapel, warranted no t t o cut in the eye, was not \nsharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be.  \nThe Ghost was greatly pleased to find h im in this mood, and \nlooked upon h im with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be \nallowed to stay until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could \nnot be done.  \n“Here is a new game,” said Scrooge. “One half hour, Spirit, only \none!”  \nIt was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge’s nephew had \nto think o f something, and the rest m ust find ou t what; he only \nanswering to their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire \nof questioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was \nthinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a \nsavage a nimal, an animal t hat growled and grunted sometimes, and \ntalked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, \nand wasn’t made a show of, and wasn’t led by anybody, and didn’t \nlive in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a \nhorse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a \ncat, o r a bear. At every fresh qu estion that was put t o him, this \nnephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 65 \ntickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last \nthe plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:  \n“I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!”  \n“What is it?” cried Fred.  \n“It’s your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!”  \nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, \nthough some objected that the reply to “Is it a bear?” ought to have \nbeen “Yes;” inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to \nhave diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had \never had any tendency that way.  \n“He has given u s plenty of merriment, I am sure,” said Fred, \n“and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health. Here is a glass of \nmulled wine ready to our hand at t he moment; and I say, ‘Uncle \nScrooge!’ ”  \n“Well! Uncle Scrooge!” they cried.  \n“A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, \nwhatever he is!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “He wouldn’t t ake it from \nme, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!”  \nUncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of \nheart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, \nand thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him \ntime. But t he whole scene passed o ff in the breath o f the last word \nspoken by his nephew; and h e a nd the Spirit were again upo n their \ntravels.  \nMuch they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, \nbut always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and \nthey were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by \nstruggling men, and they were patient i n their greater hope; by \npoverty, and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery’s \nevery refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made \nfast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught \nScrooge his precepts.  \nIt was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his \ndoubts of this, b ecause the Christmas Holidays appeared to be \ncondensed into the space of time they passed together. It was strange, \ntoo, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 66 \nGhost grew older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, \nbut never spoke of it, until they left a children’s Twelfth Night party, \nwhen, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he \nnoticed that its hair was grey.  \n“Are spirits’ lives so short?” asked Scrooge.  \n“My life upon this globe, is very brief,” replied the Ghost. “It \nends to-night.”  \n“To-night!” cried Scrooge.  \n“To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near.”  \nThe c himes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at t hat \nmoment.  \n“Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,” said Scrooge, \nlooking intently at the Spirit’s robe, “but I see something strange, and \nnot belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a \nclaw?”  \n“It might be a  claw, for the flesh there is upon it,” was the \nSpirit’s sorrowful reply. “Look here.”  \nFrom the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, \nabject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and \nclung upon the outside of its garment.  \n“Oh, Man! look h ere. Look, look, do wn h ere!” exclaimed the \nGhost.  \nThey were a boy and g irl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, \nwolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth \nshould h ave filled their f eatures out, and touched them with its \nfreshest ti nts, a stale a nd shrivelled h and, like that of age, h ad \npinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels \nmight have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No \nchange, no d egradation, no p erversion o f humanity, in any grade, \nthrough all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so \nhorrible and dread. \nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to h im i n \nthis way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked \nthemselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous \nmagnitude.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 67 \n \n \n“Spirit! are they yours?” Scrooge could say no more.  \n“They are Man’s,” said the Spirit, looking down upon them. \n“And they cling to me, appealing from t heir fathers. This boy is \nIgnorance. This girl i s Want. Beware them both, and all of their \ndegree, but m ost of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that \nwritten which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!” cried \nthe Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. “Slander those who \ntell it ye! Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And \nabide the end!”  \n“Have they no refuge or resource?” cried Scrooge.  \n“Are there no prisons?” said the Spirit, turning on  h im for the \nlast time with his own words. “Are there no workhouses?”  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 68 \nThe bell struck twelve.  \nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the \nlast stroke cea sed to v ibrate, h e remembered the prediction o f old \nJacob Marley, and lifting up h is eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, \ndraped and hoo ded, coming, like a  mist along the ground, towards \nhim.  \n69 \n \n \n \nSTAVE  IV \nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS \n \nTHE Phantom slowly, g ravely, silently approached. When it came \nnear him, Scrooge bent down upon h is knee; for in the very air \nthrough which this Spirit m oved it seemed to scatter gloom and \nmystery.  \nIt was s hrouded in a deep b lack garment, which concealed its \nhead, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one \noutstretched hand. But for this it would have been difficult to detach \nits figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it \nwas surrounded.  \nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and \nthat its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew \nno more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.  \n“I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?” \nsaid Scrooge.  \nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.  \n“You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not \nhappened, bu t will happen in the time before us,” Scrooge pursued. \n“Is that so, Spirit?”  \nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in \nits folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only \nanswer he received.  \nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge \nfeared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled b eneath h im, \nand he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 70 \nThe Spirit paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving \nhim time to recover.  \nBut Scrooge was all t he worse for this. It t hrilled h im with a \nvague uncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there \nwere ghostly eyes intently fixed upon h im, while he, though he \nstretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand \nand one great heap of black.  \n“Ghost of the Future!” he exclaimed, “I fear you more than any \nspectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and \nas I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to \nbear you company, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak \nto me?”  \nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.  \n“Lead on !” said Scrooge. “Lead on ! The night i s waning fast, \nand it is precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!”  \nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge \nfollowed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, \nand carried him along.  \nThey scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather seemed \nto spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there \nthey were, in the heart of it; on ’Change, amongst the merchants; who \nhurried up and do wn, and chinked the money in their pockets, and \nconversed in groups, and looked at t heir watches, and trifled \nthoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had \nseen them often.  \nThe Spirit stopped b eside one little knot of business men. \nObserving that t he hand was pointed to them, Scrooge a dvanced to \nlisten to their talk.  \n“No,” said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, “I don’t know \nmuch about it, either way. I only know he’s dead.”  \n“When did he die?” inquired another.  \n“Last night, I believe.”  \n“Why, what was the matter with h im?” a sked a third, taking a \nvast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. “I thought he’d \nnever die.”  \n“God knows,” said the first, with a yawn.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 71 \n“What has he done with h is money?” a sked a red-faced \ngentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that \nshook like the gills of a turkey-cock.  \n“I haven’t heard,” said the man with the large c hin, yawning \nagain. “Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn’t left it to me. That’s \nall I know.”  \nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.  \n“It’s likely to b e a very cheap funeral,” said the same speaker; \n“for upon my life I don’t know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we \nmake up a party and volunteer?”  \n“I don’t mi nd going if a lunch is provided,” observed the \ngentleman with the excrescence on his nose. “But I must be fed, if I \nmake one.”  \nAnother laugh.  \n“Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,” said the \nfirst speaker, “for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat l unch. \nBut I’ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, \nI’m not at all sure that I wasn’t his most particular friend; for we used \nto stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!”  \nSpeakers and listeners s trolled away, and mixed with o ther \ngroups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an \nexplanation.  \nThe Phantom glided o n into a street. Its finger pointed to two \npersons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation \nmight lie here.  \nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: \nvery wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of \nstanding well i n their esteem: i n a business point of view, that i s; \nstrictly in a business point of view.  \n“How are you?” said one.  \n“How are you?” returned the other.  \n“Well!” said the first. “Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?”  \n“So I am told,” returned the second. “Cold, isn’t it?”  \n“Seasonable for Christmas time. You’re not a skater, I suppose?”  \n“No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!”  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 72 \nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, \nand their parting.  \nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should \nattach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling \nassured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to \nconsider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to \nhave any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was \nPast, and this Ghost’s province was the Future. Nor could he think of \nany one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply \nthem. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had \nsome latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure \nup every word h e heard, and everything he saw; and especially to \nobserve the shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an \nexpectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue \nhe missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy.  \nHe looked about i n that very place for his own image; but \nanother man stood in h is accustomed corner, and though the c lock \npointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of \nhimself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It \ngave him lit tle surprise, ho wever; for he had b een revolving in h is \nmind a change of life, and thought and ho ped he saw his new-born \nresolutions carried out in this.  \nQuiet and d ark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its \noutstretched hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, \nhe fancied from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to \nhimself, that t he Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It m ade \nhim shudder, and feel very cold.  \nThey left t he busy scene, and went i nto an ob scure part of the \ntown, where Scrooge had n ever penetrated b efore, although he \nrecognised its situation, and its bad repute. The ways were foul and \nnarrow; t he shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, \ndrunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, \ndisgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the \nstraggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, \nand misery.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 73 \nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, \nbeetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, \nbones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor within, were \npiled up h eaps of r usty keys, nails, chains, h inges, files, scales, \nweights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to \nscrutinise were bred and h idden in mountains of unseemly rags, \nmasses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the \nwares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-\nhaired rascal, nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself \nfrom t he c old air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous \ntatters, hun g upon a line; and smoked h is pipe in all the luxury of \ncalm retirement.  \nScrooge a nd the Phantom came into the presence of this man, \njust as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had \nscarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; \nand she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no \nless s tartled by the sight of them, than they had b een upon the \nrecognition of each other. After a short period of blank astonishment, \nin which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all t hree \nburst into a laugh.  \n“Let t he c harwoman alone to b e the first!” cried she who had \nentered first. “Let t he laundress alone to b e the second; and let t he \nundertaker’s man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here’s a \nchance! If we haven’t all three met here without meaning it!”  \n“You couldn’t have met i n a better place,” said o ld Joe, \nremoving his pipe from his mouth. “Come into the parlour. You were \nmade free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an’t strangers. \nStop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks! There an’t \nsuch a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and \nI’m sure there’s no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We’re all \nsuitable to ou r calling, we’re well m atched. Come into the parlour. \nCome into the parlour.”  \nThe p arlour was the space behind the screen o f r ags. The old \nman raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed \nhis smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it i n \nhis mouth again.  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 74 \nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her \nbundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; \ncrossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at \nthe other two.  \n“What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?” said the woman. \n“Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He always did.”  \n“That’s true, indeed!” said the laundress. “No man more so.”  \n“Why then, don ’t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; \nwho’s the wiser? We’re not going to pick holes in each other’s coats, \nI suppose?”  \n“No, indeed!” said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. “We \nshould hope not.”  \n“Very well, then!” cried the woman. “That’s enough. Who’s the \nworse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I \nsuppose.”  \n“No, indeed,” said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.  \n“If he wanted to k eep ’em after he was dead, a wicked o ld \nscrew,” pursued the woman, “why wasn’t he natural in his lifetime? If \nhe had been, he’d have had somebody to look after him when he was \nstruck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by \nhimself.”  \n“It’s the truest word that ever was spoke,” said Mrs. Dilber. “It’s \na judgment on him.”  \n“I wish it was a little heavier judgment,” replied the woman; \n“and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid \nmy hands on anything else. Open that bundle, o ld Joe, and let m e \nknow the value of it. Speak out plain. I’m not afraid to be the first, nor \nafraid for them to see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping \nourselves, before we met here, I believe. It’s no sin. Open the bundle, \nJoe.”  \nBut the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the \nman in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder. \nIt was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-\nbuttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally \nexamined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 75 \ndisposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a \ntotal when he found there was nothing more to come.  \n“That’s your account,” said Joe, “and I wouldn’t give a nother \nsixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who’s next?”  \nMrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, \ntwo old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few \nboots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.  \n“I always give too much to ladies. It’s a weakness of mine, and \nthat’s the way I ruin myself,” said old Joe. “That’s your account. If \nyou asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I’d \nrepent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown.”  \n“And now undo my bundle, Joe,” said the first woman.  \nJoe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of \nopening it, and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a \nlarge and heavy roll of some dark stuff.  \n“What do you call this?” said Joe. “Bed-curtains!”  \n“Ah!” returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her \ncrossed arms. “Bed-curtains!”  \n“You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings and all, with \nhim lying there?” said Joe.  \n“Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?”  \n“You were born to make your f ortune,” said Joe, “and you’ll \ncertainly do it.”  \n“I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by \nreaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, \nJoe,” returned the woman coolly. “Don’t drop that oil upon the \nblankets, now.”  \n“His blankets?” asked Joe.  \n“Whose e lse’s do you think?” replied the woman. “He isn’t \nlikely to take cold without ’em, I dare say.”  \n“I hope he didn’t die of anything catching? Eh?” said o ld Joe, \nstopping in his work, and looking up.  \n“Don’t you be afraid of that,” returned the woman. “I an’t so \nfond o f his company that I’d loiter about him for such things, if he \ndid. Ah! you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 76 \nwon’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It’s the best he had, and \na fine one too. They’d have wasted it, if it hadn’t been for me.”  \n“What do you call wasting of it?” asked old Joe.  \n“Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,” replied the woman \nwith a laugh. “Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off \nagain. If calico an’t good enough for such a purpose, it i sn’t good \nenough for anything. It’s quite as becoming to the body. He can’t look \nuglier than he did in that one.”  \nScrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped \nabout their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man’s lamp, \nhe viewed them with a detestation and d isgust, which could h ardly \nhave been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing \nthe corpse itself.  \n“Ha, ha!” laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a \nflannel bag with money in it, told ou t t heir several gains upon the \nground. “This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away \nfrom him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, \nha!”  \n“Spirit!” said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. “I see, I \nsee. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends \nthat way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”  \nHe recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and n ow he \nalmost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which, beneath a \nragged sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was \ndumb, announced itself in awful language.  \nThe room was very dark, too d ark to b e observed with any \naccuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it i n o bedience to a secret \nimpulse, anxious to kn ow w hat kind o f r oom it was. A pale light, \nrising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered \nand bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.  \nScrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its s teady hand was \npointed to the head. The c over was s o carelessly adjusted that t he \nslightest raising of it, the motion o f a finger upon Scrooge’s part, \nwould h ave disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it \nwould b e to do,  and longed to do it; but had no  more power to \nwithdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 77 \nOh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and \ndress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy \ndominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst \nnot turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It \nis not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not \nthat t he heart and pu lse a re still; but that t he hand WAS op en, \ngenerous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a \nman’s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds springing from \nthe wound, to sow the world with life immortal!  \nNo voice pronounced these words in Scrooge’s ears, and yet he \nheard them when h e looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man \ncould b e raised up no w, what would b e his foremost t houghts? \nAvarice, hard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich \nend, truly!  \nHe lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a \nchild, to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory \nof one kind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, \nand there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What \nthey wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and \ndisturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.  \n“Spirit!” he said, “this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not \nleave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!”  \nStill the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.  \n“I understand you,” Scrooge returned, “and I would do it, if I \ncould. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.”  \nAgain it seemed to look upon him.  \n“If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by \nthis man’s death,” said Scrooge quite agonised, “show that person to \nme, Spirit, I beseech you!”  \nThe Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like \na wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a  \nmother and her children were.  \nShe was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for \nshe walked up and down the room; started at every sound; looked out \nfrom the window; glanced at the clock; tried, but in vain, to work with \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 78 \nher needle; and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their \nplay.  \nAt length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the \ndoor, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and \ndepressed, though he was young. There was a remarkable expression \nin it now; a kind o f serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and \nwhich he struggled to repress.  \nHe sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the \nfire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until \nafter a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer.  \n“Is it good?” she said, “or bad?”—to help him.  \n“Bad,” he answered.  \n“We are quite ruined?”  \n“No. There is hope yet, Caroline.”  \n“If he relents,” she said, amazed, “there is! Nothing is past hope, \nif such a miracle has happened.”  \n“He is past relenting,” said her husband. “He is dead.”  \nShe was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but \nshe was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped \nhands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but \nthe first was the emotion of her heart.  \n“What t he half-drunken woman whom I told you o f last night, \nsaid to me, when I tried to see him and ob tain a week’s delay; and \nwhat I thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been \nquite true. He was not only very ill, but dying, then.”  \n“To whom will our debt be transferred?”  \n“I don’t know. But before that time we shall be ready with the \nmoney; and even though we were not, it would b e a bad fortune \nindeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep \nto-night with light hearts, Caroline!”  \nYes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter. The \nchildren’s faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little \nunderstood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man’s \ndeath! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by \nthe event, was one of pleasure.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 79 \n“Let m e see some tenderness connected with a death,” said \nScrooge; “or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be \nfor ever present to me.”  \nThe Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his \nfeet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find \nhimself, bu t nowhere was he to b e seen. They entered poo r Bob \nCratchit’s house; t he dwelling he had visited b efore; and found the \nmother and the children seated round the fire.  \nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were a s s till as \nstatues in on e c orner, and sat l ooking up at Peter, who h ad a book \nbefore him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. \nBut surely they were very quiet!  \n“ ‘And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.’ ”  \nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had no t dreamed \nthem. The boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed \nthe threshold. Why did he not go on?  \nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to \nher face.  \n“The colour hurts my eyes,” she said.  \nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!  \n“They’re better now again,” said Cratchit’s wife. “It makes them \nweak by candle-light; and I wouldn’t show weak eyes to your father \nwhen he comes home, for the world. It must be near his time.”  \n“Past it rather,” Peter answered, shutting up h is book. “But I \nthink h e has walked a little slower than h e used, these few last \nevenings, mother.”  \nThey were very quiet again. At l ast she said, and in a steady, \ncheerful voice, that only faltered once:  \n“I have known h im walk with—I have known h im walk with \nTiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.”  \n“And so have I,” cried Peter. “Often.”  \n“And so have I,” exclaimed another. So had all.  \n“But he was very light t o carry,” she resumed, intent upon h er \nwork, “and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble. \nAnd there is your father at the door!”  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 80 \nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter—he \nhad need of it, poor fellow—came in. His tea was ready for him on \nthe hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the \ntwo young Cratchits got upon h is knees and laid, each child a little \ncheek, against his face, as if they said, “Don’t mind it, father. Don’t \nbe grieved!”  \nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the \nfamily. He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry \nand speed o f Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would b e done long \nbefore Sunday, he said.  \n“Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?” said his wife.  \n“Yes, my dear,” returned Bob. “I wish you could have gone. It \nwould have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you’ll \nsee it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My \nlittle, little child!” cried Bob. “My little child!”  \nHe broke down all at once. He couldn’t help it. If he could have \nhelped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than \nthey were.  \nHe left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which \nwas lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. There was a chair \nset close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having \nbeen there, lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a \nlittle a nd composed h imself, h e kissed the little face. He was \nreconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy.  \nThey drew about t he fire, and talked; t he girls and mother \nworking still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. \nScrooge’s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, \nmeeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little—\n“just a little down you know,” said Bob, inquired what had happened \nto d istress him. “On which,” said Bob, “for he is the pleasantest-\nspoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him. ‘I am heartily sorry for \nit, Mr. Cratchit,’ he said, ‘and heartily sorry for your good wife.’ By \nthe bye, how he ever knew that, I don’t know.”  \n“Knew what, my dear?”  \n“Why, that you were a good wife,” replied Bob.  \n“Everybody knows that!” said Peter.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 81 \n“Very well observed, my boy!” c ried Bob. “I hope they do. \n‘Heartily sorry,’ he said, ‘for your good wife. If I can be of service to \nyou in any way,’ he said, giving me his card, ‘that’s where I live. Pray \ncome to me.’ Now, it wasn’t,” cried Bob, “for the sake of anything he \nmight be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was \nquite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, \nand felt with us.”  \n“I’m sure he’s a good soul!” said Mrs. Cratchit.  \n“You would be surer of it, my dear,” returned Bob, “if you saw \nand spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised—mark what I say!—\nif he got Peter a better situation.”  \n“Only hear that, Peter,” said Mrs. Cratchit.  \n“And then,” cried on e of the girls, “Peter will be keeping \ncompany with some one, and setting up for himself.”  \n“Get along with you!” retorted Peter, grinning.  \n“It’s just as likely as not,” said Bob, “one of these days; though \nthere’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and whenever \nwe part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor \nTiny Tim—shall we—or this first parting that there was among us?”  \n“Never, father!” cried they all.  \n“And I know,” said Bob, “I know, my dears, that when we \nrecollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, \nlittle c hild; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget \npoor Tiny Tim in doing it.”  \n“No, never, father!” they all cried again.  \n“I am very happy,” said little Bob, “I am very happy!”  \nMrs. Cratchit kissed h im, h is daughters kissed h im, the two \nyoung Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit \nof Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God!  \n“Spectre,” said Scrooge, “something informs me that our parting \nmoment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man \nthat was whom we saw lying dead?”  \nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come c onveyed h im, as \nbefore—though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed \nno order in these latter visions, save that they were in the Future—into \nthe resorts of business men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 82 \nSpirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just \nnow desired, until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.  \n“This court,” said Scrooge, “through which we hurry now, is \nwhere my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I \nsee the house. Let me behold what I shall be, in days to come!”  \nThe Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.  \n“The house is yonder,” Scrooge exclaimed. “Why do you point \naway?”  \nThe inexorable finger underwent no change.  \nScrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It \nwas an office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the \nfigure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.  \nHe joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had \ngone, accompanied it until t hey reached an iron gate. He paused to \nlook round before entering.  \nA churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name he had \nnow to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. \nWalled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth o f \nvegetation’s death, no t li fe; choked up with too much bu rying; fat \nwith repleted appetite. A worthy place!  \nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He \nadvanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had \nbeen, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.  \n“Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you po int,” said \nScrooge, “answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the \nthings that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only?”  \nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.  \n“Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if \npersevered in, they must lead,” said Scrooge. “But if the courses be \ndeparted from, the e nds will change. Say it i s thus with what you \nshow me!”  \nThe Spirit was immovable as ever.  \nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the \nfinger, read upon the stone of the neglected g rave his own name, \nEBENEZER SCROOGE. \n \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 83 \n \n \nThe Last of the Spirits \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 84 \n“Am I that man who lay upon the bed?” he cried, upon his knees.  \nThe finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.  \n“No, Spirit! Oh no, no!”  \nThe finger still was there.  \n“Spirit!” he cried, tight clutching at its robe, “hear me! I am not \nthe man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this \nintercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope!”  \nFor the first time the hand appeared to shake.  \n“Good Spirit,” he pursued, as down upon the ground h e fell \nbefore it: “Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me \nthat I yet may change these shadows you h ave shown me, by an \naltered life!”  \nThe kind hand trembled.  \n“I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the \nyear. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of \nall Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out t he lessons that \nthey teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!”  \nIn his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, \nbut he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit, stronger \nyet, repulsed him.  \nHolding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he \nsaw an alteration in the Phantom’s hood and d ress. It shrunk, \ncollapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.  \n85 \n \n \n \nSTAVE  V \nTHE END OF IT \n \nYES! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room \nwas his own. Best and h appiest of all, the Time before him was his \nown, to make amends in!  \n“I will li ve in the Past, the Present, and the Future!” Scrooge \nrepeated, as he scrambled out of bed. “The Spirits of all Three shall \nstrive within me. Oh Jacob Marley! Heaven, and the Christmas Time \nbe praised for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob, on my knees!”  \nHe was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that \nhis broken vo ice would scarcely answer to h is call. He had b een \nsobbing violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet \nwith tears.  \n“They are not torn down,” cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-\ncurtains in his arms, “they are not torn down, rings and all. They are \nhere—I am here—the shadows of the things that would h ave been, \nmay be dispelled. They will be. I know they will!”  \nHis hands were busy with h is garments all t his time; t urning \nthem i nside out, pu tting them on up side down, tearing them, \nmislaying them, making them parties to every kind of extravagance.  \n“I don’t know what to do!” cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in \nthe same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with h is \nstockings. “I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am \nas merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry \nChristmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hallo \nhere! Whoop! Hallo!”  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 86 \nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing \nthere: perfectly winded.  \n“There’s the saucepan that t he gruel was in!” c ried Scrooge, \nstarting off again, and going round the fireplace. “There’s the door, by \nwhich the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There’s the corner where \nthe Ghost of Christmas Present, sat! There’s the window where I saw \nthe wandering Spirits! It’s all right, it’s all true, it all happened. Ha ha \nha!”  \nReally, for a man who h ad b een ou t of practice for so many \nyears, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a \nlong, long line of brilliant laughs!  \n“I don’t know w hat day of the month it i s!” said Scrooge. “I \ndon’t know how long I’ve been among the Spirits. I don’t know \nanything. I’m quite a baby. Never mind. I don’t care. I’d rather be a \nbaby. Hallo! Whoop! Hallo here!”  \nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the \nlustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang, h ammer; ding, dong , \nbell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!  \nRunning to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No \nfog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, p iping for the \nblood to d ance to; Golden sunlight; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; \nmerry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!  \n“What’s to-day!” c ried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in \nSunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.  \n“EH?” returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.  \n“What’s to-day, my fine fellow?” said Scrooge.  \n“To-day!” replied the boy. “Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.”  \n“It’s Christmas Day!” said Scrooge to himself. “I haven’t missed \nit. The Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they \nlike. Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!”  \n“Hallo!” returned the boy.  \n“Do you know the Poulterer’s, in the next street but one, at the \ncorner?” Scrooge inquired.  \n“I should hope I did,” replied the lad.  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 87 \n“An intelligent boy!” said Scrooge. “A remarkable boy! Do you \nknow w hether they’ve sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up \nthere?—Not the little prize Turkey: the big one?”  \n“What, the one as big as me?” returned the boy.  \n“What a delightful boy!” said Scrooge. “It’s a pleasure to talk to \nhim. Yes, my buck!”  \n“It’s hanging there now,” replied the boy.  \n“Is it?” said Scrooge. “Go and buy it.”  \n“Walk-ER!” exclaimed the boy.  \n“No, no,” said Scrooge, “I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell \n’em to bring it here, that I may give them the direction where to take \nit. Come back with the man, and I’ll give you a shilling. Come back \nwith him in less than five minutes and I’ll give you half-a-crown!”  \nThe boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at a \ntrigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.  \n“I’ll send it to Bob Cratchit’s!” whispered Scrooge, rubbing his \nhands, and splitting with a laugh. “He sha’n’t know who sends it. It’s \ntwice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke a s \nsending it to Bob’s will be!”  \nThe hand in which h e wrote the address was not a steady one, \nbut write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the street \ndoor, ready for the coming of the poulterer’s man. As he stood there, \nwaiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye.  \n“I shall love it, as long as I live!” cried Scrooge, patting it with \nhis hand. “I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest \nexpression it has in its face! It’s a wonderful knocker!—Here’s the \nTurkey! Hallo! Whoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!”  \nIt was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that \nbird. He would have snapped ’em short off in a minute, like sticks of \nsealing-wax.  \n“Why, it’s impossible to carry that t o Camden Town,” said \nScrooge. “You must have a cab.”  \nThe chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which \nhe paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which h e paid for the \ncab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 88 \nto be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in \nhis chair again, and chuckled till he cried.  \nShaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake \nvery much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don ’t \ndance while you are at it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he \nwould h ave put a piece of sticking-plaister over it, and b een qu ite \nsatisfied.  \nHe dressed himself “all in his best,” and at last got out into the \nstreets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen \nthem with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking with his hands \nbehind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He \nlooked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that t hree or f our good-\nhumoured fellows s aid, “Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to \nyou!” And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds \nhe had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.  \nHe had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld the \nportly gentleman, who h ad walked into h is counting-house the day \nbefore, and said, “Scrooge a nd Marley’s, I believe?” It sent a pang \nacross his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him \nwhen they met; but he knew what path lay straight before him, and he \ntook it.  \n“My dear sir,” said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the \nold gentleman by both his hands. “How do you d o? I hope you \nsucceeded yesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to \nyou, sir!”  \n“Mr. Scrooge?”  \n“Yes,” said Scrooge. “That is my name, and I fear it may not be \npleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the \ngoodness”—here Scrooge whispered in his ear.  \n“Lord bless me!” cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken \naway. “My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?”  \n“If you please,” said Scrooge. “Not a farthing less. A great many \nback-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that \nfavour?”  \n“My dear sir,” said the other, shaking hands with him. “I don’t \nknow what to say to such munifi—”  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 89 \n“Don’t say anything, please,” retorted Scrooge. “Come and see \nme. Will you come and see me?”  \n“I will!” cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to \ndo it.  \n“Thank’ee,” said Scrooge. “I am much ob liged to you. I thank \nyou fifty times. Bless you!”  \nHe went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the \npeople hurrying to and fro, and p atted children on the head, and \nquestioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and \nup to the windows, and found that everything could yield h im \npleasure. He had never dreamed that any walk—that anything—could \ngive him so much happiness. In the a fternoon h e turned h is s teps \ntowards his nephew’s house.  \nHe passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to \ngo up and knock. But he made a dash, and did it:  \n“Is your master at home, my dear?” said Scrooge to the girl. Nice \ngirl! Very.  \n“Yes, sir.”  \n“Where is he, my love?” said Scrooge.  \n“He’s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I’ll show you \nup-stairs, if you please.”  \n“Thank’ee. He knows me,” said Scrooge, with his hand already \non the dining-room lock. “I’ll go in here, my dear.”  \nHe turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door. They \nwere looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for \nthese young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like \nto see that everything is right.  \n“Fred!” said Scrooge.  \nDear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had \nforgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the c orner with the \nfootstool, or he wouldn’t have done it, on any account.  \n“Why bless my soul!” cried Fred, “who’s that?”  \n“It’s I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let \nme in, Fred?”  \nLet him in! It is a mercy he didn’t shake his arm off. He was at \nhome in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 90 \nthe same. So did Topper when he came. So did the plump sister when \nshe came. So d id every one when they came. Wonderful party, \nwonderful games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!  \nBut he was early at t he office next m orning. Oh, h e was early \nthere. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming \nlate! That was the thing he had set his heart upon.  \nAnd h e did it; yes, h e did! The c lock struck n ine. No Bob. A \nquarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind \nhis time. Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him \ncome into the Tank.  \nHis hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too. He \nwas on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were \ntrying to overtake nine o’clock.  \n“Hallo!” growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near as he \ncould feign it. “What do you mean by coming here a t t his time of \nday?”  \n“I am very sorry, sir,” said Bob. “I am behind my time.”  \n“You are?” repeated Scrooge. “Yes. I think you are. Step this \nway, sir, if you please.”  \n“It’s only once a  year, sir,” pleaded Bob, appearing from t he \nTank. “It shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, \nsir.”  \n“Now, I’ll t ell you what, my friend,” said Scrooge, “I am not \ngoing to stand this s ort of thing any longer. And therefore,” he \ncontinued, leaping from his s tool, and giving Bob such a dig in the \nwaistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank again; “and therefore I \nam about to raise your salary!”  \nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a \nmomentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and \ncalling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.  \n“A merry Christmas, Bob!” said Scrooge, with an earnestness \nthat could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. “A merrier \nChristmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a \nyear! I’ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling \nfamily, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, ov er a \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 91 \nChristmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy \nanother coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!” \n \n \n \nScrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely \nmore; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He \nbecame as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the \ngood old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in \nthe good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, \nbut he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough \nto know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which \nsome people did no t have their f ill of laughter in the outset; and \nknowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 92 \nas well t hat they should wrinkle up their eyes in g rins, as have the \nmalady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was \nquite enough for him.  \nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, bu t lived upon the \nTotal Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of \nhim, that he knew how to k eep Christmas well, if any man alive \npossessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! \nAnd so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!  \n \n \n 93 \n \nCOPYRIGHT INFORMATION \n \nBook: A Christmas Carol \nAuthor: Charles Dickens, 1812–70 \nFirst published: 1843 \n \nThe original book is in the public domain in the United States \nand in most, if not all, o ther countries as well.
