It was all the same to him.  \nOh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a \nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, o ld \nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck \nout generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. \nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, \nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips \nblue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was \non his head, and on h is eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his \nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the \ndog-days; and didn’t thaw it one degree at Christmas.  \nExternal heat and cold h ad little influence on Scrooge. No \nwarmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew \nwas bitterer than h e, n o falling snow w as more intent upon its \npurpose, no p elting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn’t \nknow where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and \nsleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They \noften “came down” handsomely, and Scrooge never did.  \nNobody ever stopped h im i n the street t o say, with gladsome \nlooks, “My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see \nme?” No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked \nhim what it was o’clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life \ninquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind \nmen’s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming \non, would tug their owners into doo rways and up courts; and then \nwould wag their tails as though they said, “No eye at all is better than \nan evil eye, dark master!”  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 9 \nBut what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To \nedge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human \nsympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call “nuts” \nto Scrooge.  \nOnce upon a time—of all t he good d ays in the year, on  \nChristmas Eve—old Scrooge sat busy in h is counting-house. It was \ncold, b leak, b iting weather: foggy withal: and h e c ould h ear the \npeople in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their \nhands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement \nstones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it \nwas quite dark already—it had no t been light all day—and candles \nwere flaring in the windows of the neighbouring o ffices, like ruddy \nsmears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every \nchink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court \nwas of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To \nsee the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one \nmight have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a \nlarge scale.  \nThe door of Scrooge’s counting-house was open that he might \nkeep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort \nof tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, bu t t he \nclerk’s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But \nhe c ouldn’t replenish it, for Scrooge kept t he coal-box in his own \nroom; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master \npredicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the \nclerk pu t on h is white comforter, and tried to warm himself at t he \ncandle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he \nfailed.  \n“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful \nvoice. It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon him so \nquickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.  \n“Bah!” said Scrooge, “Humbug!”  \nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, \nthis nephew of Scrooge’s, that he was all i n a glow; his face was \nruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.  \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 10 \n“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “You \ndon’t mean that, I am sure?”  \n“I do,” said Scrooge. “Merry Christmas! What right have you to \nbe merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”  \n“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you \nto b e dismal? What reason h ave you to b e morose? You’re rich \nenough.”  \nScrooge having no b etter answer ready on the spur of the \nmoment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug\n```",

M.]  \n \n\n7 \n \n \n \nSTAVE  I \nMARLEY’S GHOST \n \nMARLEY was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about \nthat. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, \nthe undertaker, and the c hief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And \nScrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose to put \nhis hand to.  \nOld Marley was as dead as a door-nail.  \nMind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, \nwhat there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been \ninclined, myself, to regard a c offin-nail as the deadest piece of \nironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the \nsimile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s \ndone for. You will t herefore permit m e to repeat, emphatically, that \nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.  \nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be \notherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t know how many \nyears. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole \nassign, h is s ole residuary legatee, h is s ole friend, and sole mourner. \nAnd even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but \nthat he was an excellent m an o f business on the very day of the \nfuneral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.  \nThe mention of Marley’s funeral brings me back to the point I \nstarted from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be \ndistinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I \nam going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet’s \nFather died before the play began, there would b e nothing more \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 8 \nremarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his \nown ramparts, than there would b e in any other middle-aged \ngentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say Saint \nPaul’s Churchyard for instance—literally to astonish his son’s weak \nmind.  \nScrooge never painted out Old Marley’s name. There it stood, \nyears afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge a nd Marley. \nThe firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new \nto the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he \nanswered to both names. It was all the same to him.  \nOh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a \nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, o ld \nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck \nout generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. \nThe cold within him froze his old features,\n```",

I’ll retire to Bedlam.”  \nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge’s nephew out, had let two other \npeople in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now \nstood, with their hats off, in Scrooge’s office. They had book s and \npapers in their hands, and bowed to him.  \n“Scrooge a nd Marley’s, I believe,” said on e of the gentlemen, \nreferring to his list. “Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, \nor Mr. Marley?”  \n“Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,” Scrooge replied. \n“He died seven years ago, this very night.”  \n“We have no doub t his liberality is well represented by his \nsurviving partner,” said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.  \nIt certainly was; for they had b een two k indred spirits. At the \nominous word “liberality,” Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and \nhanded the credentials back.  \n“At t his festive season o f the year, Mr. Scrooge,” said the \ngentleman, taking up a pen, “it is more than usually desirable that we \nshould make some slight provision for the Poor and d estitute, who \nsuffer greatly at t he present tim e. Many thousands are in want of \ncommon necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common \ncomforts, sir.”  \n“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge.  \n“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman, laying do wn the pen \nagain.  \n“And the Union workhouses?” demanded Scrooge. “Are they \nstill in operation?”  \n“They are. Still,” returned the gentleman, “I wish I could say \nthey were not.”  \n“The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?” said \nScrooge.  \n“Both very busy, sir.”  \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 13 \n“Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had \noccurred to stop them in their useful course,” said Scrooge. “I’m very \nglad to hear it.”  \n“Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer \nof mind or body to the multitude,” returned the gentleman, “a few of \nus are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and \ndrink, and means of warmth. We c hoose this time, b ecause it i s a \ntime, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. \nWhat shall I put you down for?”  \n“Nothing!” Scrooge replied.  \n“You wish to be anonymous?”  \n“I wish to be left alone,” said Scrooge. “Since you ask me what I \nwish, gentlemen, that i s my answer. I don’t m ake merry myself at \nChristmas and I can’t afford to make idle people merry. I help to \nsupport the establishments I have mentioned—they cost enough; and \nthose who are badly off must go there.”  \n“Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.”  \n“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, \nand d ecrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I don’t \nknow that.”  \n“But you might know it,” observed the gentleman.  \n“It’s not my business,” Scrooge returned. “It’s enough for a man \nto und erstand h is own bu siness, and no t t o interfere with o ther \npeople’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!”  \nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the \ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved \nopinion o f himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual \nwith him.  \nMeanwhile the fog and d arkness thickened so, that people ran \nabout with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses \nin carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a \nchurch, whose gruff old b ell was always peeping slily down at \nScrooge out of a gothic window in the wall, b ecame invisible, and \nstruck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations \nafterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. \nThe cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 14 \nsome labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great \nfire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were \ngathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze \nin rapture.

The brightness of \nthe shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of \nthe windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers’ and \ngrocers’ trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with \nwhich it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as \nbargain and sale had anything to do.

What right have you to \nbe merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enough.”  \n“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you \nto b e dismal? What reason h ave you to b e morose? You’re rich \nenough.”  \nScrooge having no b etter answer ready on the spur of the \nmoment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”  \n“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.  \n“What else can I be,” returned the uncle, “when I live in such a \nworld of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! \nWhat’s Christmas time to you bu t a time for paying bills without \nmoney; a time for f inding yourself a year older, bu t not an hou r \nricher; a time for balancing your books and having every item in ’em \nthrough a round dozen o f months presented d ead against you? If I  \ncould work my will,” said Scrooge indignantly, “every idiot who goes \nabout with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his \nown pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He \nshould!”  \n“Uncle!” pleaded the nephew.  \n“Nephew!” returned the uncle, sternly, “keep Christmas in your \nown way, and let me keep it in mine.”  \n“Keep it!” repeated Scrooge’s nephew. “But you don’t keep it.”  \n“Let me leave it alone, then,” said Scrooge. “Much good may it \ndo you! Much good it has ever done you!”  \n“There are many things from which I might have derived good, \nby which I have not profited, I dare say,” returned the nephew. \n“Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of \nChristmas time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration \ndue to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be \napart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant \ntime; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when \nmen and women seem by one c onsent t o op en their shut-up h earts \nfreely, and to think o f people below them as if they really were \nfellow-passengers to the grave, and no t another r ace of creatures \nCHARLES  DICKENS \n 11 \nbound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put \na scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me \ngood, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”  \nThe c lerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming \nimmediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and \nextinguished the last frail spark for ever.  \n“Let me hear another sound from you,” said Scrooge, “and you’ll \nkeep your Christmas by losing your situation! You’re quite a \npowerful speaker, sir,” he a dded, turning to his nephew. “I wonder \nyou don’t go into Parliament.”  \n“Don’t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.”  \nScrooge said that he would see him—yes, indeed h e did. He \nwent the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see \nhim in that extremity first.  \n“But why?” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “Why?”  \n“Why did you get married?” said Scrooge.  \n“Because I fell in love.”  \n“Because you fell in love!” growled Scrooge, as if that were the \nonly one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \n“Good afternoon!”  \n“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. \nWhy give it as a reason for not coming now?”  \n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.  \n“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we \nbe friends?”  \n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.  \n“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have \nnever had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made \nthe trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my Christmas humour \nto the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”  \n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.  \n“And A Happy New Year!”  \n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.  \nHis nephew left t he room without an angry word, \nnotwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings \nA  CHRISTMAS  CAROL \n 12 \nof the season on the c lerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than \nScrooge; for he returned them cordially.  \n“There’s another fellow,” muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: \n“my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife a nd family, \ntalking about a merry Christmas. I’ll retire to Bedlam.”  \nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge’s nephew out, had let two other \npeople in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now \nstood, with their hats off, in Scrooge’s office. They had book s and \npapers in their hands, and bowed to him.  \n“Scrooge a nd Marley’s, I believe,” said on e of the gentlemen, \nreferring to his list\n```",
